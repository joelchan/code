      <abstract>
        <p>The poor often behave in less capable ways, which can further perpetuate poverty.
            We hypothesize that poverty directly impedes cognitive function and present two
            studies that test this hypothesis. First, we experimentally induced thoughts about
            finances and found that this reduces cognitive performance among poor but not in
            well-off participants. Second, we examined the cognitive function of farmers over
            the planting cycle. We found that the same farmer shows diminished cognitive
            performance before harvest, when poor, as compared with after harvest, when
            rich. This cannot be explained by differences in time available, nutrition,
            or work effort. Nor can it be explained with stress: Although farmers do
            show more stress before harvest, that does not account for diminished
            cognitive performance. Instead, it appears that poverty itself reduces
            cognitive capacity. We suggest that this is because poverty-related
            concerns consume mental resources, leaving less for other tasks.
            These data provide a previously unexamined perspective and help
            explain a spectrum of behaviors among the poor. We discuss some
            implications for poverty policy.</p>

     A variety of studies point to a correlation
     between poverty and counterproductive
    behavior. The poor use less preventive
health care (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ), fail to adhere to drug regimens (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ),
are tardier and less likely to keep appointments
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3 ref4">3, 4</xref>
        ), are less productive workers (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ), less
attentive parents (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ), and worse managers of their
finances (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7 ref8 ref9">7–9</xref>
        ). These behaviors are troubling in
their own right, but they are particularly troubling
because they can further deepen poverty. Some
explanations of this correlation focus on the
environmental conditions of poverty. Predatory
lenders in poor areas, for example, may create
highinterest-rate borrowing, and unreliable
transportation can cause tardiness and absenteeism. More
generally, poverty may leave less room for error
so that the “same” mistake can lead to worse
outcomes (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref11">10, 11</xref>
        ). Other explanations focus on the
characteristics of the poor themselves. Lower
levels of formal education, for example, may create
misunderstandings about contract terms, and less
parental attention may influence the next
generation’s parenting style.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our second study takes a different approach
and allows us to assess what happens when
income varies naturally. We conducted a field study
that used quasi-experimental variation in actual
wealth. Indian sugarcane farmers receive income
annually at harvest time and find it hard to smooth
their consumption (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ). As a result, they
experience cycles of poverty—poor before harvest and
richer after. This allows us to compare cognitive
capacity for the same farmer when poor (pre-harvest)
versus richer (post-harvest). Because harvest dates
are distributed arbitrarily across farmers, we can
further control for calendar effects. In this study,
we did not experimentally induce financial
concerns; we relied on whatever concerns occurred
naturally. We were careful to control for other
possible changes, such as nutrition and work effort.
Additionally, we accounted for the impact of stress.
Any effect on cognitive performance then observed
would thus illustrate a causal relationship between
actual income and cognitive function in situ. As
such, the two studies are highly complementary.
The laboratory study has a great deal of internal
validity and illustrates our proposed mechanism,
whereas the field study boosts the external
validity of the laboratory study.
      </p>
      <p>
        We note two observations about these studies.
First, they sidestep the discussion on whether
poverty is best defined in absolute or relative terms
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
        ). Because our hypothesis is about how
monetary concerns tax the cognitive system, we
define poverty broadly as the gap between one’s
needs and the resources available to fulfill them.
Because this is based on subjective needs, it
encompasses low-income individuals both in the
developing and the developed world as well as those
experiencing sharp transitory income shocks, such
as the unemployed. Second, existing theory and
data suggest a possibly cumulative long-term
impact of poverty on cognition (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22 ref23">22, 23</xref>
        ): Childhood
poverty may hinder brain development and
eventually reduce adult cognitive capacity (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
        ). Our
hypothesis and tests focus on an immediate
impact of poverty on cognition: Budgetary
preoccupations can in real time impede cognitive function.
Our proposed mechanism does not operate through
brain development at early childhood but through
an immediate cognitive load caused by financial
concerns. Whether this mechanism also
contributes to the long-term impacts is an open question.
      </p>
      <p>
        We propose a different kind of explanation,
which focuses on the mental processes required
by poverty. The poor must manage sporadic
income, juggle expenses, and make difficult
tradeoffs. Even when not actually making a financial
decision, these preoccupations can be present and
distracting. The human cognitive system has
limited capacity (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref13 ref14 ref15">12–15</xref>
        ). Preoccupations with
pressing budgetary concerns leave fewer cognitive
resources available to guide choice and action.
Just as an air traffic controller focusing on a
potential collision course is prone to neglect other
planes in the air, the poor, when attending to
monetary concerns, lose their capacity to give
other problems their full consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        This suggests a causal, not merely
correlational, relationship between poverty and mental
function. We tested this using two very different
but complementary designs (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref17">16, 17</xref>
        ). The first is a
laboratory study: We induced richer and poorer
participants to think about everyday financial
demands. We hypothesized that for the rich, these
run-of-the-mill financial snags are of little
consequence. For the poor, however, these demands
can trigger persistent and distracting concerns
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref19">18, 19</xref>
        ). The laboratory study is designed to show
that similarly sized financial challenges can have
different cognitive impacts on the poor and the
rich. But, the study cannot fully capture our
hypothesis that in the world, the poor face more
challenging demands. In principle, the cognitive
impact in situ may be different given that the
scale of the problems can vary between the rich
and the poor. Perhaps the rich in the world face     
larger monetary problems that also cause greater
load. Perhaps the poor manage to restructure their
lives so that they do not face as many cognitively
challenging problems. Put simply, the laboratory
study, although illustrating the mechanism, does
not show its relevance in natural settings.

      <title>The Laboratory Studies</title>
      <p>
        The first study consisted of four experiments,
with shoppers at a New Jersey mall who
participated for pay (details are available in the
supplementary materials). This sample encompasses
a diverse income range, with the median
household income at roughly $70,000 and a lower bound
of roughly $20,000. This, broadly speaking,
provides a cross-section of the United States, with
the poor in our sample roughly corresponding to
those in the lower quartile or third of the U.S.
income distribution. We computed effective
income by dividing household income by the square
root of household size (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        ) and defined “rich” and
“poor” through a median split on this variable (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ).
      </p>
      <p>In experiment 1, participants (n = 101) were
presented with four hypothetical scenarios a few
minutes apart. Each scenario described a
financial problem the participants might experience.
For example: “Your car is having some trouble
and requires $X to be fixed. You can pay in full,
take a loan, or take a chance and forego the
service at the moment... How would you go about
making this decision?” These scenarios, by
touching on monetary issues, are meant to trigger
thoughts of the participant’s own finances. They
are intended to bring to the forefront any nascent,
easy to activate, financial concerns.</p>
      <p>
        After viewing each scenario, and while
thinking about how they might go about solving the
problem, participants performed two
computerbased tasks used to measure cognitive function:
SCIENCE
Raven’s Progressive Matrices and a spatial
compatibility task. The Raven’s test involves a
sequence of shapes with one shape missing (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
        ).
Participants must choose which of several
alternatives best fits in the missing space. Raven’s test
is a common component in IQ tests and is used to
measure “fluid intelligence,” the capacity to think
logically and solve problems in novel situations,
independent of acquired knowledge (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28 ref29">28, 29</xref>
        ). The
spatial incompatibility task requires participants
to respond quickly and often contrary to their
initial impulse. Presented with figures on the screen,
they must press the same side in response to some
stimuli but press the opposite side in response to
others. The speed and accuracy of response
measures cognitive control (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>
        ), the ability to guide
thought and action in accordance with internal
goals (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>
        ). Both are nonverbal tasks, intended
to minimize the potential impact of literacy skills.
Upon completion of these tasks, participants
responded to the original scenario by typing their
answers on the computer or speaking to a tape
recorder and then moved on to the next scenario
(an analysis of participants’ responses to the
scenarios is available in table S1). We also collected
participants’ income information at the end of the
experiment.
      </p>
      <p>Participants were randomly assigned either to
a “hard” condition, in which the scenarios
involved costs that were relatively high (for
example, the car would require $1500 to fix); or to an
“easy” condition, where costs were lower (for
example, the car would require $150 to fix). Because
the sums in the easy condition are small, we
expected this condition to evoke few of one’s own
monetary concerns, for either poor or rich
participants. In contrast, the large sums in the hard
condition, we hypothesized, would evoke
monetary concerns in the poor but not in the rich
participants.</p>
      <p>
        Cognitive performance in experiment 1 is plotted
in Fig. 1. For the financially “easy” scenarios,
designed to generate relatively trivial concerns, the
poor and rich performed similarly [Raven’s: t(50) =
0.13, P = 0.90; cognitive control: t(50) = 1.55, P =
0.13]. In contrast, in the context of the financially
“hard” condition, the poor performed significantly
worse than did the rich on both Raven’s [t(47) =
3.21, P &lt; 0.01] and on cognitive control [t(47) =
5.22, P &lt; 0.001]. A two-way analysis of variance
revealed a robust interaction between income and
condition [Raven’s: F(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1,97</xref>
        ) = 5.12, P = 0.03;
cognitive control: F(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1,97</xref>
        ) = 7.86, P &lt; 0.01]. In both
tasks, the rich were uninfluenced by condition
[Raven’s: t(48) = 0.56, P = .58; cognitive control:
t(48) = 1.04, P = 0.30], whereas the poor
performed significantly worse in the hard condition
[Raven’s: t(49) = 2.63, P = 0.01; cognitive
control: t(49) = 3.98, P &lt; 0.001]. As a result, the poor
performed reliably worse than the rich performed
overall [Raven’s: F(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1,97</xref>
        ) = 5.61, P = 0.02;
cognitive control: F(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1,97</xref>
        ) = 23.24, p &lt; 0.001]. The
magnitudes of the effect here are substantial, with
Cohen’s d in this and ensuing replications ranging
between 0.88 and 0.94.
      </p>
      <p>To rule out the effect of “math anxiety,”
experiment 2 used the same set of numbers as in
experiment 1 but with nonfinancial scenarios. This
recreates a mathematical problem but without
evoking financial concerns. There was no
interaction between the difficulty of the scenario and
participants’ income (further details are available
in supplementary materials, experiment 2). Thus,
the reduced cognitive performance in the poor
participants in experiment 1 was not due to anxiety
with large numbers.</p>
      <p>
        Experiment 3 added incentives to experiment
1: In addition to the standard participation fee,
participants earned $0.25 for every correct
response on both tasks. Performance in experiment
3 (n = 100 participants) is summarized in Fig. 2.
As before, the poor performed similarly to the
rich in the easy condition [Raven’s: t(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>
        ) = 0.26,
P = 0.79; cognitive control: t(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>
        ) = 1.02, P =
0.31] and worse in the hard condition [Ravens:
t(50) = 3.34, P &lt; 0.01; cognitive control: t(50) =
3.54, P &lt; 0.001]. The rich performed equally well
in the easy and hard conditions [Raven’s: t(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>
        ) =
0.07, P = 0.94; cognitive control: t(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>
        ) = 1.42,
P = 0.16], whereas the poor performed
significantly worse in the hard condition [Raven’s: t(51) =
3.75, P &lt; 0.001; cognitive control: t(51) = 3.67,
P &lt; 0.001], yielding a robust interaction between
income and scenario [Raven’s: F(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1,96</xref>
        ) = 4.34,
P = 0.04; cognitive control: F(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1,96</xref>
        ) = 4.31, P =
0.04]. Despite the incentives, and the fact that
they presumably needed the money more, the poor
performed worse overall [Raven’s: F(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1,96</xref>
        ) = 6.55,
P = 0.01; cognitive control: F(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1,96</xref>
        ) = 11.88, P &lt;
0.001] and earned 18% ($0.71) less than the rich
earned.
      </p>
      <p>The hypothetical scenarios are intended to
trigger participants’ financial concerns. Yet in
experiments 1 to 3, the cognitive tests themselves
may have created additional load because they
were performed while the participant was
contemplating the scenarios. To rule this out, experiment
4 (n = 96 participants) replicated experiment 1,
except that participants finished responding to
each scenario before proceeding to the Raven’s
and cognitive control tasks. That is, participants
viewed each scenario as in experiment 1,
responded to the scenario, and only then completed
the Raven’s and cognitive control tasks. Because
there were no intervening tasks between scenario
presentation and response, we added a few
scenariorelevant questions in order to equate the time
spent with that of experiment 1. Performance is
summarized in Fig. 3.</p>
      <p>
        The results match those in experiments 1 and
3. As before, there was a robust interaction
between income and condition [Raven’s: F(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1,92</xref>
        ) =
4.04, P = 0.04; cognitive control: F(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1,92</xref>
        ) = 6.66,
P = 0.01]; the rich and poor performed similarly
in the easy condition [Raven’s: t(48) = 0.41, P =
0.69; cognitive control: t(48) = 0.43, P = 0.67],
and the poor performed significantly worse than
the rich performed in the hard condition [Ravens:
t(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>
        ) = 3.55, P &lt; 0.001; cognitive control: t(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>
        ) =
3.34, p = .002]. Condition was insignificant for
the rich [Raven’s: t(47) = 0.08, P = 0.93;
cognitive control: t(47) = 0.72, P = 0.47], but
significant for the poor [Raven’s: t(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>
        ) = 3.26, P =
0.002; cognitive control: t(59) = 3.94, P &lt; 0.001].
Again, the poor performed worse than the rich
performed overall [Raven’s: F(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1,92</xref>
        ) = 6.42, P = 0.01;
cognitive control: F(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1,92</xref>
        ) = 8.74, P = 0.004].
      </p>
      <p>Although remarkably consistent, these
findings have limitations. The causal attribution made
possible by laboratory studies comes at the expense
of some external validity. For example, in
experiment 4 the hypothetical scenarios themselves—
even after answers were given—may still have
weighed on people’s minds. More generally, in
all the experiments we explicitly primed monetary
concerns. Such explicit priming may not mirror
naturally occurring circumstances. It is possible that
environments in which one is richer bring to mind
other concerns (such as bigger purchases), creating
load comparable with that experienced by the
poor. It is also possible—though less plausible—
that the poor structure their lives to avoid these</p>
      <p>
concerns. To address these issues, we conducted
the field study.
Our second study examined 464 sugarcane
farmers living in 54 villages in the
sugarcanegrowing areas around the districts of Villupuram
and Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu, India. These
were a random sample of small farmers (with
land plots of between 1.5 and 3 acres) who earned
at least 60% of their income from sugarcane
and were interviewed twice—before and after
harvest—over a 4-month period in 2010. There
were occasional nonresponses, but all of our
prepost comparisons include only farmers we
surveyed twice.</p>
      <p>A challenge with pre-post comparisons is
calendar effects: Differences between months (such
as a festival or the weather) can create a spurious
correlation. We overcame this through a
particular feature of this context: Farmers’ harvest (and
planting) dates are staggered over a 3- to 5-month
period being set by sugar mills with processing
capacity constraints. One farmer may harvest, for
example, in June, whereas another harvests in August.
The same month then is pre-harvest for some
farmers and post-harvest for others. This feature
allows us to control for calendar effects.</p>
      <p>Our data show that farmers indeed faced
greater financial pressures pre- as compared with
post-harvest: They pawned items at a higher rate
(78 versus 4%, P &lt; 0.001, n = 462 participants)
and were more likely to have loans (99 versus
13%, P &lt; 0.001, n = 461 participants). On
average, farmers had 1.97 more loans before harvest
than they did after it. They were also more likely
to answer “Yes” to the question, “Did you have
trouble coping with ordinary bills in the last fifteen
days?” before harvest than after (1.62 and 1.76,
respectively, on a 3-point scale, where 1
corresponded to low ability and 3 to high ability to cope;
P &lt; 0.001, n = 462 participants). (Regressions
adjusted to take out farmer and month fixed
effects are shown in Table 1, panel A.)</p>
      <p>We again used Raven’s to gauge fluid
intelligence. For cognitive control, we could not
administer the spatial incompatibility task in the
</p>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>Raven’s Matrices</title>
        <p>
field. Instead, we used a numeric version of the
traditional Stroop task, which is appropriate for
participants with low literacy rates. In a typical
trial, participants would see “5 5 5” and have to
quickly respond “3,” which is the number of 5s
in the sequence, rather than “5” that comes to
mind most naturally. Both response speed and
error rates were recorded. Each participant
performed 75 trials on the numerical Stroop.</p>
        <p>Pre- and post-harvest differences on both tests
were pronounced and are illustrated in Fig. 4. On
Raven’s, the farmers scored an average of 5.45
items correct post-harvest but only 4.35 items
correct pre-harvest (P &lt; 0.001, n = 460
participants). On Stroop, they took an average of 131 s
to respond to all items post-harvest, as compared
with 146 s pre-harvest (P &lt; .001, n = 452). In
addition, the average number of errors the
farmers committed was higher before harvest than
after (5.93 versus 5.16 errors; P &lt; .001, n = 453).</p>
        <p>We also report results of regressions that
control for farmer and month fixed effects (Table 1,
panel B). Each cell in Table 1 is a distinct
regression. Table 1, column 1 shows that even after
regression adjustment, strong pre-post harvest
differences remain for both Raven’s and Stroop
performance. In addition to these pre-post
differences, we found that farmers’ perceived intensity
of how financially constrained they are—as
captured by how they rate their ability to cope with
ordinary bills in the preceding 15-day period—
correlates negatively with performance on Raven’s
and time taken on Stroop tests (table S2).</p>
        <p>Other factors besides income that vary
preand post-harvest could drive these effects. One
major candidate is physical exertion; preparing
the land for harvest might involve increased
physical labor. Another candidate is anxiety over
crop yield; farmers might be preoccupied not with
making ends meet but with how much they will
earn. In practice, neither is likely to be true in the
case of sugarcane farming. Farmers typically use
external labor on their lands, and sugarcane crop
size can be readily estimated months before
harvest. Still, to address this further we observe that
there is a several-week delay between physical
harvest and the actual receipt of payment.

      <sec id="sec-2-2">
        <title>Cognitive Control Cognitive Control</title>
        <p>
Financial burdens are only relieved at the time of
payment, but labor and anxiety over crop size are
fully resolved at the time of harvest. For 316
farmers in our sample, the “pre-harvest” survey was
actually post–physical harvest but pre-payment.
We reestimated our equation on this subsample as
shown in Table 1, column 2, and found highly
similar results, which suggests that neither physical
exertion nor anxiety pre-harvest drives our results.</p>
        <p>Training effects present another potential
confound; post-harvest farmers may do better simply
because they are taking the test a second time. To
address this, we held back 100 randomly selected
farmers at the time of initial sampling. These
farmers were surveyed for the first time
postharvest, and their scores were compared with
the post-harvest scores of the original sample. If
our results were due to learning, we would expect
these novice farmers to do worse. Instead, we
found that they performed similarly on Raven’s
accuracy and Stroop reaction time (table S3),
suggesting no training effect. There is some evidence
for training effects on Stroop error rates (table S3),
but the overall pattern cannot be attributed to
simple test familiarity. Taken together, the two
sets of studies—in the New Jersey mall and the
Indian fields—illustrate how challenging
financial conditions, which are endemic to poverty, can
result in diminished cognitive capacity.</p>
        <p>
          We have argued that the attentional demands
created by poverty are a plausible mechanism
(
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>
          ). But there could be other mediating factors.
Nutrition is one candidate—in the harvest
findings, if not in the mall study; farmers may eat less
when poor. In 2009, we ran a pilot study with
the same design in the districts of Thanjavur,
Thiruvarur, Perambalur, and Pudokottai in Tamil
Nadu, in which we surveyed 188 farmers and
also asked about food consumption. We found
similar effects on Stroop (1.47 errors post-harvest
versus 2.12 errors pre-harvest; P = 0.006 via t
test, n = 111 participants). Pre-harvest farmers
were not eating less; they spent 2663 rupees a
month on food pre-harvest and 2592 rupees
postharvest (roughly $53 and $52, respectively, not
accounting for purchasing power parity).
Additionally, the Stroop results persist even in
regressions in which food consumption is included as a
control variable.
        </p>
        <p>A potential explanation of these findings is
stress. Financial concerns could reasonably
induce stress in pre-harvest farmers. Indeed, we
examined biological stress. In the 2009 study, we
collected two biomarkers of stress: heart rate and
blood pressure. Both measures showed that the
farmers were more stressed before the harvest;
heart rate was higher pre-harvest than
postharvest (78.42 versus 76.38; P = 0.088 via t test,
n = 188 participants), and so were diastolic blood
pressure (78.70 versus 74.26, P &lt; 0.001 via t test,
n = 188) and systolic blood pressure (128.64
versus 121.56, P &lt; 0.001 via t test, n = 188).</p>
        <p>
          However, these differences in stress do not
explain our findings. When we reestimated the
impact of harvest on Stroop performance, controlling
SCIENCE
for all three stress measures, the findings remained
significant. In fact, the coefficient on post-harvest
did not change [for Stroop, we continued to find a
coefficient of –1.46 (0.52) on the post-harvest
dummy, with a t of –2.80 and P &lt; 0.006; n = 222
participants]. This suggests that although the
preharvest farmers did experience stress, stress cannot
fully explain the impairment in cognitive function.
Our suggested mechanism—that poverty captures
attention, triggers intrusive thoughts, and reduces
cognitive resources—could itself be described
colloquially as “stress”: persistent mental engagement
induced by some trigger. The 2009 data,
however, suggest that the biological view of stress—as
proxied by these biomarkers of stress—is not
sufficient to account for our findings. This is consistent
with the existing literature on the effects of stress
on cognitive function, in which both facilitation
and impairment have been found (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
          ). For
example, there is evidence that stress can increase
working memory capacity (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>
          ).
        </p>
        <p>
          We find attentional capture to be the most
compelling explanatory mechanism. It matches
findings on the effects of scarcity on borrowing
(
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>
          ) and is consistent with demand and
distraction observed in domains of scarcity other than
poverty—from insufficient time to limited calorie
budgets (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>
          ). But surely, other mechanisms might
be operating. For example, poverty might
influence cognitive load by changing people’s
affective state (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref37">36, 37</xref>
          ). We hope future work will test
other mechanisms for explaining these findings.

      <title>New Perspectives on Policy</title>
      <p>The data reported here suggest a different
perspective on poverty: Being poor means coping
not just with a shortfall of money, but also with a
concurrent shortfall of cognitive resources. The
poor, in this view, are less capable not because of
inherent traits, but because the very context of
poverty imposes load and impedes cognitive
capacity. The findings, in other words, are not about
poor people, but about any people who find
themselves poor.</p>
      <p>
        How large are these effects? Sleep researchers
have examined the cognitive impact (on Raven’s)
of losing a full night of sleep through
experimental manipulations (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>
        ). In standard deviation
terms, the laboratory study findings are of the
same size, and the field findings are three quarters
that size. Put simply, evoking financial concerns
has a cognitive impact comparable with losing a
full night of sleep. In addition, similar effect sizes
have been observed in the performance on Raven’s
matrices of chronic alcoholics versus normal adults
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>
        ) and of 60- versus 45-year-olds (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>
        ). By way
of calibration, according to a common
approximation used by intelligence researchers, with a mean
of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 the effects
we observed correspond to ~13 IQ points. These
sizable magnitudes suggest the cognitive impact
of poverty could have large real consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        This perspective has important policy
implications. First, policy-makers should beware of
imposing cognitive taxes on the poor just as they
avoid monetary taxes on the poor. Filling out long
forms, preparing for a lengthy interview,
deciphering new rules, or responding to complex incentives
all consume cognitive resources. Policy-makers
rarely recognize these cognitive taxes; yet, our
results suggest that they should focus on reducing
them (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ). Simple interventions (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>
        ) such as smart
defaults (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>
        ), help filling forms out (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>
        ), planning
prompts (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>
        ), or even reminders (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>
        ) may be
particularly helpful to the poor. Policy-makers should
further recognize and respond to natural variation
in the same person’s cognitive capacity. Many
programs that impose cognitive demand on
farmers, for example, from HIV education to
agricultural extension services (which provide farmers
with information about new seeds, pesticides, and
agricultural practices) should be carefully timed.
At the very least, as our results suggest, they should
be synchronized with the harvest cycle, with greater
cognitive capacity available post-harvest. One
recent study illustrated this with fertilizer. Farmers
made higher-return investments when the
decision was made right after harvest as compared
with later in the season (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>
        ). The data suggest a
rarely considered benefit to policies that reduce
economic volatility: They are not merely
contributing to economic stability—they are actually
enabling greater cognitive resources.
