        <p>This paper describes the work undertaken in the Scholarly Ontologies
          Project. The aim of the project has been to develop a computational
          approach to support scholarly sensemaking, through interpretation
          and argumentation, enabling researchers to make claims: to describe
          and debate their view of a document's key contributions and relationships
          to the literature. The project has investigated the technicalities
          and practicalities of capturing conceptual relations, within
          and between conventional documents in terms of abstract ontological
          structures. In this way, we have developed a new kind of index
          to distributed digital library systems. This paper reports a
          case study undertaken to test the sensemaking tools developed
          by the Scholarly Ontologies project. The tools used were ClaiMapper,
          which allows the user to sketch argument maps of individual papers
          and their connections, ClaiMaker, a server on which such models
          can be stored and saved, which provides interpretative services
          to assist the querying of argument maps across multiple papers
          and ClaimFinder, a novice interface to the search services in
          ClaiMaker. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Researchers are benefiting from improved access to documents through digital
        libraries, electronic journals, eprint archives, etc., but improved
        access brings its own problems. There is less time to track the
        growing numbers of conferences, journals and reports they can access.
        Researchers are interested in questions such as: How does the expert
        community perceive this theory, model, language, empirical result?
        Where did this idea come from? What kind of evidence supports it
        and challenges it? Are there different schools of thought on this
        issue? Answers to these kinds of questions arise out of the private
        sensemaking activity which is integral to reading the literature.
        By ‘sensemaking’ we refer to
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">Weick’s (1996</xref>
        ) work on how individuals and groups construct meaning when confronted
        by complex, sometimes contradictory information. We literally ‘make
        sense’ by giving form to our evolving understanding of the meaning
        of data and ideas, as we seek to relate them to our existing conceptual
        structures, through writing, talking, sketching and other forms
        of external representation. In the absence of a single canonical
        view of the world, we must construct ‘plausible narratives’ to
        fill in the gaps. Within scholarly discourse, there are accepted
        ways of establishing (and contesting) plausibility. In this kind
        of sensemaking, past reading assists the interpretation of related
        documents which in turn lead the reader on to explore new texts.
      </p>
      <p>In this paper, we describe the prototype tools which have been developed
        to support sensemaking and report on a case study in which the
        tools were put to use. In Section 2, we present the aims of the
        Scholarly Ontologies Project, for which the tools were developed
        and outline its approach to representing scholarly argument. In
        Section 3, we present related work. In Section 4, we describe the
        tools, ClaiMapper, ClaiMaker and ClaimFinder. In Section 5, we
        report on the case study. This study had two parts. In the first,
        ClaiMapper was used to construct a model of a literature as a network
        of claims. This part was about the use of the tools to record and
        support sensemaking. In the second part of the study, ClaiMaker
        and ClaimFinder were used to examine the claim network. This part
        looked at whether the models could be usefully interpreted by users
        other than the creator. In Section 6 we reflect on the advantages
        and limitations of the approach.</p>

      <title>2. The Scholarly Ontologies Project</title>
      <p>The Scholarly Ontologies Project was an EPSRC project, funded as
        part of the programme on Distributed Information Management, with
        the aim of developing a ‘claims server’ to support scholarly interpretation
        and argumentation. It investigated the practicality of publishing
        explicit, semi-formal conceptual structures in a collective knowledge
        base. These structures are grounded in conventional documents which
        are accessible, via hyperlinks, directly from the claims server.
        In this way, the claims server has the additional role of a new
        kind of index to distributed digital library collections. The system
        enables researchers to make claims: to describe and debate their
        view of a document’s key contributions and relationships to the
        literature. 2.1. Representing interpretation and argument</p>
      <p>
        ‘‘Ontology’’ is the term used in knowledge modelling to describe an abstract
        specification of concepts, attributes and relationships whose meanings
        are agreed by the ontology’s users
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Gruber, 1993)</xref>
        . Typically, ontologies are applied to control interpretation or semantic
        annotation in a specific domain, such as travel, enabling interoperability
        between, for instance, airline and hotel booking sites.
      </p>
      <p>In contrast, we propose an ontology not only to represent consensus,
        but also principled disagreement, which can support multiple interpretations.
        These might be different interpretations of the claims in a single
        paper or between a number of papers. The resolution of the apparent
        contradiction between the use of ontologies to control interpretation
        and our use of an ontology to represent multiple interpretations
        comes from the observation that, while researchers do not necessarily
        agree on the issues under debate, the mechanisms of scholarly debate
        do remain stable over time. Whether research is in the arts or
        sciences, there will always be problems that are of key interest,
        people will put forward theories, predictions, hypotheses, etc.,
        and try to support them with data and analysis. These contributions
        may, in their turn, be challenged or developed further. In order
        to tackle the problem of multiple interpretations, our knowledge
        modelling effort has focused on capturing these enduring, discipline-independent
        relationships between objects, which we call discourse relations,
        rather than the types of objects. This and other requirements for
        the ontology required for representing scholarly debate in a claims
        server are outlined in Table 1.</p>
      <p>The base form of the representation is a directed graph in which
        Concepts form the nodes and the links are drawn from a taxonomy
        of discourse relations. Concepts are stored as short pieces of
        free text succinctly summarising a contribution, at whatever granularity
        the researcher wishes.</p>
      <p>A claim is a triple of two such objects connected by a link (Fig.
        1). Other objects which may be used as nodes in claims include
        sets (collections of concepts) and claims themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the ontology we have a taxonomy of link types to represent the rhetoric
        of researchers when they present their arguments (see Fig. 2).
        Relations are classified into groups with similar rhetorical implications:
        Supports/ Challenges, Problem Related, Taxonomic, Causal, Similarity
        and General. Each relation belongs to exactly one of these groups.
        Some of these groups, such as Supports/ Challenges and Problem
        Related enable the user to take positions. Others, particularly
        the Causal and Taxonomic relations, support the building of models
        of domains for arguments to refer to. These are not argumentation
        relations. However, we discovered that they were necessary to allow
        users to provide supporting material to make their arguments comprehensible.
        It can be argued that these two categories of groups should be
        split at a higher level of the taxonomy into relations about content
        and relations about positions. However we have not followed this
        route in the version presented here. The design and evolution of
        the ontology is described by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">Buckingham Shum et al. (2002</xref>
        ).
      </p>
      <p>
        Its theoretical relationship to discourse relations theory, specifically
        Cognitive Coherence Relations theory, is detailed in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">Mancini (2005)</xref>
        .2
      </p>
      <p>Each relation is identified by a natural language label.</p>
      <p>This can be changed for communities with different rhetorical styles
        helping us tackle requirements 1 and 6 in Table 1.</p>
      <p>Each relation is assigned two properties: a polarity which indicates
        whether it has positive or negative implications (e.g. the label
        proves has positive polarity whereas refutes has negative polarity;
        it implies disproof) and a weight (high or low) which indicates
        how forceful it is (e.g. refutes is more forceful than disagreesWith).
        The assignment of polarity allows us to tackle requirement 2 in
        Table 1. The assignment of polarity and weighting is illustrated
        for the Supports/Challenges class in Table 2.</p>
      <p>In addition to Concepts, two other kinds of object can be used as
        the nodes in Claims. These are Sets, groups of concepts brought
        together by the user because they share a</p>
      <p>
        2Cognitive Coherence Relations theory is derived from research into coherence
        relations in text and speech. Approaches in these fields such as
        Discourse Representation Theory (DRT)
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Kamp, 1981)</xref>
        focus on modelling formally sentential relationships and sub-structure,
        but this is too fine a granularity to expect from users except
        trained discourse analysts. Approaches such as DRT might be used
        to analyse the content of concepts in claims. 422 1. Mimic natural
        language expressions to reduce the cognitive gap: The underlying
        structure should be based on a noun/verb metaphor with the relations
        taking the role of verbs. Making arguments in pseudo-natural language
        was intended to make the scheme intuitive for contributors. 2.
        Permit the expression of dissent: A classical truth maintenance
        model would not be fit for purpose; if ‘‘truth’’ is established
        on an issue, it ceases to be worth doing research about. The scheme
        must therefore be closer to that presented by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">Toulmin (1958)</xref>
        , with evidence being presented in favour of claims and complemented by
        counter-claims. To support or challenge a claim, the modeller uses
        relations with either positive or negative polarity. The concept
        of polarity is drawn from the work of Knott and Mellish on Cognitive
        Coherence Relations (CCR)
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Knott and Mellish, 1996)</xref>
        . To agree with a proposition, the relation used would have positive polarity.
        To disagree it would have negative polarity. Giving relations polarity
        opens up the possibility of providing services at a higher level
        of granularity than that of individual link labels. See
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">Mancini and Buckingham Shum (2004</xref>
        ) and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">Uren et al. (2004)</xref>
        for further discussion on CCR. 3. Signal the ownership of public content:
        Contributors must take responsibility for the claims they make
        because we depend on the social control of peer pressure to motivate
        high quality claim making. Although a peer-reviewing process could
        be conceived we have not attempted one in the early prototypes.
        Ownership also has a key role in the claims server as digital library
        server: claims would be ‘‘backed up’’ by a link to a published
        paper. There is an analogy here with Toulmin’s warrants. 4. Accommodate
        the social dimensions to being explicit: Argument modelling invites
        researchers to consider making explicit what is normally implicit
        in the text of a paper
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(discussed in Buckingham Shum et al., 2000)</xref>
        . Consider a relation refutes. This is a forceful term and therefore should
        carry greater weight in calculations than, for example, takes issue
        with. From the social side, some contributors might prefer to use
        the less extreme term when linking to concepts created by eminent
        figures. Providing these soft options recognises the social dimensions
        to citation, and aims to remove a possible barrier to adoption.
        5. Assign concepts no category outside of use: We require that
        the typing of object should be optional and that objects may change
        their type depending on the context. A key precept of conventional
        approaches to ontologies is that objects in a scheme are typed
        under one or more classes. While this is acceptable for non-controversial
        attributes such as Software, this cannot be sustained when we are
        talking about the role that a concept plays in multiple arguments.
        The concept that is a Problem under debate in one paper may be
        an Assumption in another (or even within the same paper). The scheme
        must therefore allow the same concept to take on several types
        in different situations. 6. Assist in making connections across
        disciplinary boundaries: We are trying to identify a core set of
        argumentation relations that are useful in many disciplines. However,
        the precise terms used for making a case will differ from one research
        community to another. We tackle this using the idea of dialects.
        Drawing again on Cognitive Coherence Relations (see 2.), we define
        a core set of relational classes, with properties such as type,
        polarity and weight, but these may be reified with natural language
        labels in many ways. For instance, a community in which it would
        be strange or unacceptable to refute someone’s work could change
        the label to something they felt more comfortable with (e.g. raises
        serious questions), but the basic properties of the strongly negative
        relation that challenges a concept would remain unchanged. This
        method would let us configure claim servers for different communities
        without altering the underlying reasoning engine. common theme
        and Claim triples themselves. This single level of nesting allowed
        users to build complex arguments, while mitigating the implementation
        difficulties posed by fully recursive structures. Later in the
        prototyping cycle an extension of Sets was implemented which allows
        an element of a Set to be another Set or a claim. This allows more
        deeply nested structures to be built.
      </p>
      <p>A concept may be assigned a type (e.g. /DataS /EvidenceS /HypothesisS).
        However typing of concepts is optional (although in a pedagogical
        context it might be appropriate to enforce concept typing as a
        way to lead students to think more carefully about their claims).</p>
      <p>Optional typing is unusual in ontologies but is motivated by the
        observation, made in requirement 5 of Table 1, that objects may
        play different roles in different contexts, since researchers may
        disagree on the node’s type: e.g. is this</p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>Language also a Theory? Is this based on Opinion or Data?</title>
        <p>One person’s underlying Theory may be someone else’s Problem. An
          author may even problematize an idea later on in a text, which
          she has up to that point treated as an unproblematic Theory,
          Language, etc. Our approach, therefore, is that if a type is
          assigned it is stored as part of the link connecting it to another
          concept rather than as an intrinsic part of the concept. This
          has the effect of making node-typing context dependent and thus
          permits multiple typing of the same concept in different relations.
          We also argue that for some relations typing the concepts is
          redundant since the role of the nodes is implied by the relation
          type. The link types is evidence for, which implies the left-hand
          node is a piece of evidence and addresses, which implies the
          right-hand side is a problem and the left a remedy, are examples
          of this behaviour.</p>
        <p>The cost of this approach is that removing any compulsion on users
          to type their concepts does reduce the level of detail of analysis
          possible. Here we chose to trade off computational power against
          cognitive load on users and produced a ‘‘good enough’’ representation.
          We envisage that certain communities might want to complement
          the discourse ontology with their own specialist vocabularies,
          particularly where these are widely used; for example, a biomedical
          version might need to type concepts that are genes, enzymes,
          proteins, etc. However domain specific extensions of this type
          were not attempted in the generic prototype discussed in this
          paper.

        <p>To illustrate discourse ontology links in use, we will examine
          some claim triples based on arguments presented in Borodin et
          al.’s paper ‘‘Finding Authorities and Hubs From Link Structures

          the label is capable of causing. One of the sources for this
          claim in the paper reads: ‘‘ythese examples seem indicative of
          the topic drift potential of the principal eigenvector in the
          Kleinberg algorithm’’. This is an example of how the discourse
          ontology constrains the modeler, here to make a claim which is
          rather stronger than that in the original paper. How should we
          read causal statements in Scholonto? We have stated that we wish
          to deal with models of the arguments people make, rather than
          propositions about the world (see requirement 2). Yet this claim
          looks on the surface like a proposition that could take a truth-value.
          However, if we add in the metadata stored for claims about the
          creator and backing paper, the claim could be read as: Uren states,
          that Kleinberg claims, that ‘‘TKC effect—algorithm favours tight
          knit communities’’ is capable of causing ‘‘topic drift’’. The
          claim as a whole is able to be used as a node within other claims;
          for example, a claim about a (hypothetical) rebuttal made by
          Kleinberg or another reader/modeller’s interpretation of the
          same text.</p>
        <p>Fig. 3 shows the three claims above in the context of the claim
          network in which they were created. The arrangement is dominated
          by the claim highlighted in the centre of the model: ‘‘TKC effect—algorithm
          favours tightly knit communities’’ is different to ‘‘SALSA behaviour—algorithm
          mixes authorities from different communities’’. This Fig. 3.

        <p>
          The use of familiar metaphors is essential when presenting new technologies
          to users to reduce the barrier to uptake. In designing the representational
          scheme for the Scholarly Ontologies project we sought familiar
          sensemaking methods that link ideas. The Mind Maps developed
          by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">Buzan (1989)</xref>
          are well established as a sensemaking method in education and business.
          Mind Maps typically have the main topic in the centre of the
          map with subtopics and subsubtopics radiating off like seeds
          on the head of a dandelion. However the focus on a central concept
          is too restricting a practice for sensemaking in research literatures,
          where people may explore several inter-related topics and so
          the fundamentally hierarchical Mind Map method would not be appropriate.
          Therefore we took an approach which is more akin to the concept
          mapping method proposed by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">Novak and Gowin (1984)</xref>
          . In concept mapping the concepts are linked into networks, rather than
          hierarchies, giving more freedom to express the interrelations
          between ideas. The notion of labelling links, which is widely
          used in concept mapping, is also important. However, because
          we wanted to be able to construct services using our links, we
          needed to have a degree of control over the kinds of links modellers
          would use and support the reuse of structures via a server.

          In developing this vocabulary of link types we were aware of a trade-off
          between usability and expressiveness. Users may be wary of a
          very complex system, preferring not to use it rather than be
          seen to make a ‘‘mistake’’. On the other hand very simple systems
          impose too many constraints on the types of models users can
          build. Therefore while we drew on theoretical work such as that
          on Cognitive Coherence Relations
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref24">(Knott and Mellish, 1996; Knott and Sanders, 1998)</xref>
          we took a pragmatic approach to selecting relations, aiming for a moderate
          palette of useful links rather than a very complete set such
          as that proposed by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">Trigg (1983)</xref>

          which also uses discourse relations. We note that they too selected relations
          that could be understood by users, rather than ‘‘precise’’ or
          ‘‘complete’’ relations. Selected examples of discourse relations
          used in Trellis include: provides background for, in contrast

        <p>
          There are parallels between the typing of links and the typing of citations.
          Since citation databases first became available authors have
          proposed systems for categorising authors’ motives and/or the
          rhetorical role citations play, e.g.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">Lipetz (1965)</xref>
          ,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">Weinstock (1971)</xref>

          and
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Garzone and Mercer (2000)</xref>
          . While these schemes are varied they share common elements, such as corroborating/affirmative,
          negational/correcting, methodology, background/assumed knowledge,
          which we recognize also among the relational types of our own
          ontology and Gil’s. We are convinced that citation indexes would
          be greatly improved by this kind of typing and are investigating
          its application in other projects. However to be economic it
          must be automated and this is a substantial challenge for natural
          language researchers. Much of the automatic classification of
          citations carried out to date has been aimed at document summarisation
          and argumentative zoning (finding the parts of papers that play
          different roles) rather than directly at citation classification,
          e.g.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">Nanba and Okumura (1999)</xref>
          and
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">Teufel and Moens (2000)</xref>
          . It is an interesting observation that these authors employ very basic
          categorisation schemes of just three or four key types. Nanba
          and Okumura have
        </p>
        <p>
          Type B—the references to base on other researchers’ theories or methods,
          Type C—the references to compare with related works or to point
          out their problems, Type O—the references other than types B
          and C, whereas Teufel and Moens have Background, Other work,
          Weakness/Contrast and Own contribution. By contrast, Mercer et
          al. are investigating textual cues to mark up a two tier system
          with 34 base types divided between 10 upper categories
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">(Mercer and Di Marco, 2004)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          We are convinced that citation indexes would be greatly improved by this
          kind of typing. Although at present, it is fair to say that these
          techniques are still in a relatively early state of development.
          Apart from providing an automated technique to apply to a specific
          document corpus (once properly trained), the key difference to
          our approach is that the granularity of our work is the claim,
          as opposed to the document. The complementarity between the two
          approaches hold potential, however, and

      <title>4. The tools</title>
      <p>Three prototype tools were used in the case study reported in Section
        5 of this paper. The first is ClaiMapper, a sketching tool that
        supports users in making sense of the claims in papers. When the
        user is satisfied with part or entire claim network produced in
        ClaiMapper it can be imported into the second tool ClaiMaker. This
        is a digital library server that connects claims via hyperlinks
        to the documents they describe and provides search services to
        help users explore large claim networks. The third tool is ClaimFinder.
        This is an alternative interface to ClaimMaker, designed for use
        by novices, which contains the simpler search functions presented
        more accessibly.</p>
      <sec id="sec-5-1">
        <title>4.1. ClaiMapper argument sketching tool</title>
        <p>The first prototype for building claim networks was a form-filling
          interface which can be accessed directly through the ClaiMaker
          server. This interface has one form to create Concepts, another
          to create Sets and a variety of forms for creating different
          kinds of Claims. This was a quick route to allow the research
          team to start populating the database with claims in order to
          put the ontology through its paces and create a collection for
          testing services, but it did not provide much sensemaking support
          to modellers. For instance, while the project team did become
          adept at choosing from among the many options on the interface,
          they reported difficulty holding a gestalt view of the model
          in their heads as they went through the dissociated steps of
          building Concepts and Sets, then assembling them into Claims.
          It was clear that some radical changes were needed to the interface
          if it was to support the cognitive processes involved in creating
          claim networks.</p>
        <p>
          In order to overcome the problems of holding complex models in memory,
          the project team sometimes found themselves resorting to pen
          and paper for sketching out drafts of argument maps. An extreme
          example showing a paper-based concept network describing several
          papers is shown in Fig. 4: each sheet of paper has a sketch of
          the claims in one paper, the arrows drawn between sheets on the
          white board represent claims which use concepts from two different
          papers. This sketching stage was adopted in part because the
          form-filling interface had no correction facility. It prevented
          users from deleting or modifying a concept which might meanwhile
          have been included in someone else’s model. However it was mainly
          driven by a desire to refine the user’s own interpretation before
          committing it to the knowledge base. In the terms of Green’s
          cognitive dimensions analysis the interface was ‘‘enforcing premature
          structure’’
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref40">(Green, 1990; Shipman and Marshall, 1999)</xref>
          , by making the users commit a structure before they were comfortable that
          they had made sense of what they were reading.
        </p>
        <p>It was clear that a new interface should offer better support for
          this sketching stage, which enables the refinement part of the
          sensemaking process. It therefore had to assist the process of
          sketching draft maps and reviewing new structures in context
          before committing them to the knowledge base. This was implemented
          by modifying Compendium, a hypertext visual modelling tool.4
          The result was a desktop sketching tool called ClaiMapper in
          which a small number of icon conventions are used to produce
          visualisations of concepts and the connections between them.</p>
        <p>The ClaiMapper conventions are illustrated in Fig. 5. The right
          pane is an open document that contains two concepts (represented
          by the orb icon) and a set, which contains two other concepts
          (represented by the bullet list icon with the subscript 2 indicating
          the number of concepts contained in the set). These are linked
          to form two Claim triples. A Claim triple comprises two objects
          joined by a directed, labelled link. We refer to the objects
          conventionally as the left- and right-hand objects, the left
          hand being the place the link comes from and the right hand the
          place it links to. Of the claims in Fig. 5, one has on the left
          hand the set and on the right hand one of the concepts linked
          by the relation is analogous to. The second claim has on the
          left hand the concept labelled One Claim can contain another
          and on the right hand the whole of the first Claim triple (represented
          by the is similar to link pointing to the centre of the is analogous
          to link). Using ClaiMapper in this way we can clearly visualize
          the nesting described in Section 2.1.</p>
        <p>The structures in the right document of Fig. 5 are structures that
          can be uploaded to the ClaiMaker server and analysed. However
          the ClaiMapper tool does not restrict the user from making other
          kinds of informal structure that are helpful to the organisation

          ment of their ideas. For example, the left window in Fig. 5 is
          being used as if it were a folder to hold a collection of documents
          on the same topic.</p>
        <p>While the user works in the ClaiMapper environment they can edit
          the structures they build at will. However in order to access
          the interpretational services provided by ClaiMaker they will
          eventually have to decide that their interpretation of a particular
          document is ‘‘good enough’’ to be uploaded to a private or shared
          database. At this point the structures that have been uploaded
          are synchronized with the server by being given unique IDs (see
          Fig. 15b, IDs are numbers in angle brackets). Subsequently ClaiMapper
          prevents editing of those structures, for example, changing a
          label, which would cause a mismatch with the server version.
          The user is still free to link to them, in which case the additional
          claims can be uploaded to the server. Structures can also be
          deleted from the ClaiMapper version, since the server version
          does not require users to have a full copy of the server model
          on their local machine it will not detect an error. The user
          can also download their own and other modellers’ structures from
          the server for use in ClaiMapper.</p>

        <title>4.2. ClaiMaker server software</title>
        <p>The ClaiMaker server combines a number of roles. It supports model
          building, through the original form-based interface and through
          model upload via XML files exported by ClaiMapper. It also provides
          a range of search, visualisation and discovery services. Implementing
          ClaiMaker as a server application has a number of practical advantages.
          In the development stage it facilitated getting new versions
          to early adopters; changes made to the server are available to
          users without them having to regularly update their local software.
          It also gave the project team access to the models people built
          allowing us to assess the modeling scheme and identify difficulties.
          Uploading claims once to a server is a much easier way for a
          distributed group of collaborators to share their annotations
          than circulating files of annotations which each member of the
          group must upload individually to view them. Finally, to support
          ClaiMaker’s role as a digital library system, the choice of a
          server, in which links can be made to digital resources via URLs,
          is obvious.
        </p>
        <p>The data (Concepts, Sets, Claims, bibliographic metadata, etc.)
          are stored in a MySQL database which underlies all the functions.
          A mirror of the database in RDF was also maintained at one stage
          on a Lisp server. This allowed us to experiment with services
          that exploited the structure in the link ontology to a greater
          extent. We were able to develop some interesting services using
          this technology, e.g., lineage, which will be discussed further
          below. However, we found that the technical difficulties of maintaining
          two intercommunicating servers were too great for us (and probably
          for potential users as well). Consequently we found ways to recast
          these services as complex SQL statements that replicate most
          of the functionality of the RDF-based search.</p>
        <p>We will not describe the model building functions of ClaiMaker,
          since the form-based interfaces it uses have been largely superseded
          by the sketching technology used in ClaiMapper. We will concentrate
          instead on the search, visualisation and discovery functions.
          Later we will demonstrate how some of these functions were used
          to analyse the claim network produced using ClaiMapper. 428 4.2.1.
          Search
        </p>
        <p>ClaiMaker has a basic set of services that allow the user to find
          documents, concepts, sets and links by searching for title text,
          author, creator, creation date, etc. As a first step these give
          tabular listings of the type shown in Figs. 6 and 7. From these
          listings further information about the objects returned can be
          found using the icons located with them. These open supplementary
          information boxes that overlay the main listing. Working from
          left to right on the concepts in Fig. 6 the ‘‘i’’ icon will bring
          up further information about the concept itself (who created
          it, when, any further details input by the creator, etc.). The
          ‘‘anchor’’ icon sets this concept as the focal node in a Neighbourhood
          search (described shortly). The document node gives the bibliographic
          details of the document that backs the concept up and a hyperlink
          to the original. The final ‘‘person’’ icon gives details of the
          person who created the object.</p>
        <p>The listing for links (see Fig. 7) shows for each claim the two
          objects that are joined in the first and third columns with an
          arrow icon between them. The same icon set is used to access
          additional information and the colour of the arrow depends upon
          the properties of the link so that red links represent links
          with negative polarity and green links have strong weight and
          positive polarity (the rest are gold). Referring back to Table
          2, ‘‘improves on’’ is shown with a green arrow, ‘‘is different
          to’’ with a red arrow and less Fig. 6. Part of the listing of
          results from a concept search for the string ‘‘human’’. strongly
          negative/positive relations such as ‘‘is evidence for’’, ‘‘addresses’’

        <p>In addition to the tabular layout search results which contain
          claims can be viewed using interactive views generated using
          the TouchGraph5 visualisation package. For example Fig. 8 is
          a TouchGraph rendering of search results. The visualisation can
          be explored by the user via the locality, zoom and rotate functions,
          or filtered by link type using the menu shown. Further information

        <title>4.2.3. Discovery</title>
        <p>Developing discovery services has been a core activity within the
          Scholarly Ontologies project. Traditional information retrieval
          systems use term-based search and search via citations. Term-based
          search handles documents as isolated entities defined by the
          words in them. Citations in a document do give an indication
          of the links between documents but there are many motives for
          citing and a reference list gives no indication of authors’ intentions
          in referring to other work. We generally cannot even tell if
          a paper is referenced because the authors support it or are diametrically
          opposed to it, although interesting research is being done to
          improve this situation (see Section 3).</p>
        <p>In this section, we describe four of the discovery services that
          we have developed. The examples of discovering the neighbourhood
          and discovering chains, demonstrate services to assist the user
          in exploring and navigating the topologies of argument maps.
          The examples of discovering disagreement and discovering lineage
          demonstrate how the explicit connections embedded in the discourse
          ontology can be used to build services that assist the user in
          answering common research questions, e.g. ‘‘Where did this idea
          come from?’’ A typical discovery service comprises a search of
          the claims network followed by a presentation of results (which
          may be a visualisation) tailored to the particular question.
          4.2.3.1. Discovering the neighbourhood. The Neighbourhood search,
          which can be reached from tabular results listings via the anchor
          icon gives answers to the question ‘‘What is directly related
          to this?’’ It allows the user to examine all the claims made
          with one or more chosen object/s on either the left- or the right-hand
          side. The focal concepts can be searched for using a keyword
          search, or a search for all the concepts in a particular paper,
          or by picking up an anchor icon from a previous results listing,
          or by picking up an anchor icon from one of the left-or righthand
          column headings in the neighbourhood table which selects all
          the concepts in that column as focal concepts. The focal concepts
          are listed in the central column of the neighbourhood listing
          (see Fig. 9). Because it embeds the Fig. 7. Part of the results
          listing for a search for links.</p>

          <p>anchor icon in its own results listing (see Fig. 9), the neighbourhood
            service allows users to step through complex networks following
            routes that are interesting to them. 4.2.3.2. Discovering chains.
            The link-tracking service has similarities to neighbourhood
            but allows the user to specify more parameters, for example
            the length of chains to be found and their direction, by filling
            in slots in a simple form. Fig. 10 presents an example of the
            output of this service in TouchGraph format for a search for
            chains of one link out from any Concept on the left hand of
            a claim triple containing the string ‘‘CiteSeer’’. 4.2.3.3.
            Discovering disagreement. Consider a common question that many
            researchers bring to a literature: ‘‘What arguments are there
            against this paper?’’ Despite the centrality of the notion
            of disagreement in the assessment of evidence, there is not
            even a language in which to articulate such a query to a digital
            library. With our ontology modelling the world of scholarly
            discourse, we can begin to express the basic idea that researchers
            disagree; it is the idea embedded in the property negative
            polarity.
          </p>
          <p>How can we operationalize such a query? First, we are looking
            for arguments against, which map on to the ontology as relations
            of any type with negative polarity. At a trivial level, this
            paper corresponds to the currently selected document in ClaiMaker.
            But more substantively, this paper refers to the claims that
            researchers have made about the document, specifically, the
            concepts linked to it. Moreover, we can extend this to related
            concepts, using the following definition: the extended set
            of concepts linked by a positive relation to/from the document’s
            immediate concepts, i.e., discovering chains of disagreement
            or agreement.</p>
          <p>For the given document, this discovery service does the following:
          </p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-5-4-2">
          <title>1. Finds the concepts associated with that paper.</title>
          <p>2. Extends the set of concepts by adding positively linked concepts
            from other papers. 3. Finds concepts that link to these with
            negative relations. 4. Returns the concepts from step 3 as
            concepts against the extended concept set.</p>
          <p>This approach has dangers. It does not follow that if A is in
            agreement with B and B is in disagreement with C then A must
            be in disagreement with C also. However it should be remembered
            that this is a search service. It is up to the user to judge
            whether the claims returned are valid.</p>
          <p>Typical results are presented in Fig. 11. Note the two numbers
            to the right of the claim that disagrees with one of the related
            issues in the query. The first (8621) is a hyperlink to the
            metadata of the paper that provides the backing for the claim,
            which includes a URL to the paper itself. The second (2) is
            a link to the personal details of the modeller who made the
            claim; this allows the user to make a judgement about the credentials
            of the claim: can it be trusted? 4.2.3.4. Discovering lineage.
            A common activity in research is clarifying where a particular
            idea came from and what other ideas influenced its development.
            We call this the lineage behind an idea. Lineage is the notion
            that ideas build on each other and has an inverse, the descendant,
            which is the notion that ideas are spawned by a particular
            seminal notion. Where the paths have become increasingly indirect
            over time or been confused, uncovering unexpected or surprising
            lineage is a major scholarly contribution. We have a more modest
            goal to start with in ClaiMaker: to provide a tool pick out
            from the ‘spaghetti’ of claims, candidate streams of ideas
            that conceptually appear to be building on each other.</p>
          <p>In practice, our lineage tool tracks back (semantically, not
            in time) from a concept to see how it evolved, whereas the
            descendants tool tracks forward from a concept to see what
            new ideas evolved from it. Since descendants are the inverse
            of lineage (and are implemented as its literal inverse) we
            will only discuss lineage. A lineage can be conceptualized
            as a path in which the links suggest development or improvement
            (Fig. 12).</p>
          <p>
            The constraints are chosen to reflect the ideas of improvement and development.
            The set of permitted link types comprises the two general links
            uses/applies/is enabled by or improves on and links of type
            similarity and positive polarity. The improves on link type
            is included to reflect the notion of improvement, while uses/applies/is
            enabled by has the weaker implication of development. The similarity
            links are included because if a new concept is like a second
            that improves on a third concept, then the new concept is likely
            to be an improvement on the third concept as well. The problem
            of finding lineage in ClaiMaker can then be formulated as a
            path-matching problem, a wellknown problem in graph theory,
            which searches for paths (sequences) of links that follow a
            specific pattern. The first prototype of the lineage service
            used an RDF representation of the argument maps and the Ivanhoe
            path matcher embedded in the Wilbur RDF Parser
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Lassila, 2001)</xref>
            . This approach is described in our other papers:
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref7">Buckingham Shum et al. (2003</xref>
            ) and
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">Uren et al. (2003)</xref>
            . Due to operational difficulties with supporting a Lisp server in parallel
            with the ClaiMaker server this approach was later dropped and
            we adopted a slightly weaker approach to lineage based on a
            chain search with the links going away from the home node,
            pruned using constraints based on the link ontology. The descendants
            algorithm is the same except that the links in the chain are
            directed towards the home node.
          </p>
          <p>The procedure is as follows: (1) The user inputs a home node
            H and a number of steps N, the maximum length of lineage they
            wish to search through. (2) Find all links in the direction
            away from H (H is the left-hand side of the triple) that meet
            the set of 432 constraints (type similarity and positive polarity,
            improves on, uses/applies/is enabled by). (3) Define the output
            set H’ containing all the terminal nodes of the paths found
            in step 2. (4) Eliminate from H’ any nodes that have been encountered
            before in this search. (5) For each node in H’ repeat steps
            2 and 3 and build a new set of terminal nodes to search from.
            (6) Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a total of N cycles have been
            completed.
          </p>
          <p>Two things were lost in the MySQL implementation, compared to
            the first RDF-based prototype. The first is that we can no
            longer handle similarity links as symmetric links, i.e. we
            can no longer ignore their direction. The second is that, because
            MySQL has poor facilities for recursion by comparison with
            Lisp, the user must now set the maximum number of links they
            wish to see in a chain.</p>

        Fig. 13. ClaimFinder interface ‘‘Find’’ screen. Scientometrics, the study
        of scientific research literature using citation data, has been
        used to study the development of ideas and identify emerging topics
        for some years
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref49">(White and McCain, 1989; van Raan, 1997)</xref>
        . The process generally involves the selection of a body of citation data
        in a field of interest, followed by computation to identify structures
        of interest, which are then analysed by an expert to interpret
        what the structures mean in terms of the development of the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scientometrics overlaps with the study of social networks, which models
        nets of relationships between people
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">(Pool and Kochen, 1978/79)</xref>
        , via coauthorship studies. In this case, the relationship link is made
        if two authors have published together and may be weighted according
        to the number of coauthored publications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extension of scientometric practices to analyse the World Wide Web,
        sometimes called Webometrics, is being actively explored, although
        not without caveats concerning the signification of hyperlinks
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Cronin, 2001)</xref>
        . For scholarly hyperlinks, studies have shown that researchers motives
        for hyperlinking are closely related to their existing citation
        behaviour
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Kim, 2000)</xref>
        . Therefore it may be reasonable to assume that scholarly hyperlinks are
        suitable for scientometric study.
      </p>
      <p>
        This view is reinforced by the successful development of Web ranking algorithms
        that exploit information about the links between Web pages, e.g.,
        PageRank
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">(Page et al., 1998)</xref>
        and HITS
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Kleinberg, 1999)</xref>
        . Using link information as part of the ranking strategy is considered
        advantageous because links from domains other than a page’s home
        domain represent some kind of human endorsement of the content.

        <title>5.1. Sketching and refining interpretation with ClaiMapper</title>
        <p>In the first phase of the evaluation we used ClaiMapper and ClaiMaker
          to build a claim network. The first author undertook the review
          and initial modelling of the literature in ClaiMapper. By the
          end of this process some 290+ nodes, 340+ links and 64 document
          nodes had been created. Ideally, we would have like to have had
          the Claim Network built by a neutral third party. However, since
          the person who built the review had to be familiar with the tools
          and willing to commit several weeks of working time, we were
          constrained to select one of ourselves.</p>
        <p>It was observed that the overall sensemaking process with ClaiMapper
          fell into three cycles, which overlapped and followed in sequence,
          but with backtracking (see Fig. 14). The initial cycle is the
          Gather–Read–Categorize cycle, in which a collection of potentially
          useful material was obtained, scanned and roughly sorted into
          topics. The middle cycle is the Read–Model–Categorize cycle.
          Here the papers were studied in more detail, the arguments were
          mapped and refinements were made to the categories used. The
          final cycle was the Model–Reflect– Write cycle, in which the
          claim networks were used to draft summaries on each of the topics.
          Backtracking occurred, e.g., when writing and reflecting opened
          up new questions which required more documents to be gathered.</p>
        <p>ClaiMapper provided a space in which to sketch rough ideas, then
          refine them. It was found that, in this case Fig. 14. Review
          Processes using ClaiMapper. study, the degree of order in the
          models seemed to increase over time. For example, in Fig. 15a
          the first screen shot is taken from a backup of the ClaiMapper
          database taken at a relatively early stage, roughly at the end
          of the first Gather–Read–Categorize cycle, whereas the second
          screenshot (Fig. 15b) was taken after several Read–Categorize–Model
          cycles, while writing was in progress.</p>
        <p>In Fig. 15a, the Home Window: is being used as a scribble pad.
          Concepts of interest are dotted about and linked to each other
          and to documents, some represent research articles while others
          are being used as containers to organize material, rather like
          a folder in a hierarchical file system. One of these containers
          has been opened; and contains one document and a series of unconnected
          concepts. At this point, the structure has some of the aspects
          of an argument model, related ideas have been joined up at the
          upper level, but it is largely mnemonic: a sketch of ideas that
          arose from the initial scan and deserve further investigation.</p>
        <p>By the time the screenshot in Fig. 15b was taken, the structure
          of the models had become more organized. The Home Window now
          contains just eight documents, each of which is acting as a container
          for documents on a particular topic. The containers have been
          organized into a shallow hierarchy with ‘‘bibliometrics’’ at
          the top. One of these container documents has been opened. It
          contains an unconnected list of documents each of which represents
          an actual article. The right hand small pane shows the argument
          model for one of these articles. This is expressed using the
          constraints of the ontology described above and is a machine-interpretable
          structure that could be uploaded to ClaiMaker as a representation
          of this document.</p>
        <p>
          We can see in this process that ClaiMapper was able to support the refinement
          aspect of sensemaking. It appears that as the modeller learnt
          more about the topic and became more committed to her interpretation
          of the data, a crystallisation process occurred in which the
          models became more organized and clear categories emerged. It
          is a classic example of the move from rough sketches to coherent
          argument, a phenomenon reported both in empirical studies of
          designers using argumentation-based design rationale and empirical
          studies of the use of computer-supported writing tools, reviewed
          in

          .
        </p>
        <p>The use of documents as containers in which to subdivide papers
          by category in this case study may have arisen from the multi-disciplinary
          nature of the task. This is an interesting example of affordances
          of the system emerging that were not designed in as functions.
          One reason that documents could stand in as containers is that
          ClaiMapper permits transclusion,6 so papers which bridged categories
          6In Hypertext research, ‘transclusion’ is a term invented by
          Ted Nelson for the republishing of the same content in multiple
          contexts, such that the system treats the material correctly
          and the end-user is aware of the reuse. In ClaiMapper (and Compendium
          on which it is based) transclusion manifests as nodes which can
          be edited directly from any of their contexts, which display
          where they are transcluded and support quick navigation between
          these contexts. See Selvin and Buckingham Shum (2005) for an

          in either place would appear automatically in the other. (footnote

          and sensemaking in long-term research projects.</p>
        <p>The hierarchy shown in Fig. 15b was used to provide the sectioning
          for the first draft of the review. This sectioning was changed
          later because it did not give sufficient emphasis to the cross
          disciplinary threads that made the review interesting. However
          it provided the structure for an initial ‘‘divide and conquer’’
          step in the writing process, in which topic summaries could be
          produced simply by looking at the documents in a particular ‘‘folder’’.</p>
        <p>Clearly we cannot draw general conclusions from observations of
          one individual’s use of a tool, but it concurs with the experience
          of other team members and more broadly with the way in which
          we know learners gradually elaborate their understanding of a
          domain through concept splitting, merging and clustering. ClaiMapper
          integrated into the natural review process smoothly, adding value
          in the early stages by providing a scribble pad on which initial
          observations could be sketched and in the later stages it provided
          concept manipulation tools for ordering observations and providing
          notes on them in a way that supported writing and reflection
          on the material.</p>

        <title>5.2. Comparative evaluation</title>
        <p>The second phase of the evaluation comprised a comparative analysis
          of the two artefacts produced in phase one, namely the Claim
          network and the traditional written review. We wanted to determine
          whether the Claim network, in combination with ClaiMaker and
          ClaimFinder, could be used to communicate similar information
          to that in the written review. This is the first step in validating
          Claim networks as a collaborative tool—demonstrating that one
          person can understand another’s model. A factual questionnaire
          was used as the instrument of the study. In particular, we wanted
          to look at the overall quality of the students’ answers, how
          they handled individual questions and which features of the search
          tools the claim network group used to find answers.</p>
        <p>There are some confounding factors in the design of this experiment.
          As we have already commented, ideally the artefacts should have
          been built by a neutral third party. However this was infeasible.
          Also the quality of both the claim network and the review were
          likely to influence the quality of the answers that the students
          gave. However, the question we were seeking to answer was not
          very complex. It was simply whether claim networks could communicate
          information to people other than the creator. The review group
          give a point of comparison but differences between the media,
          the history of their preparation (the review was written after
          and based on the claim network and the questionnaire was written
          last) and the fact that it was impossible to make the content
          of the two artefacts identical force us to be cautious about
          the significance of any differences in the performance of the
          two groups.</p>
        <p>The participants in the study were six research students studying
          in KMi. None of them had prior, in-depth knowledge of the topics
          in the literature selected for the study. Half the group was
          engaged in research related to discourse mapping and literature
          analysis. These three were all familiar with the ScholOnto discourse
          ontology and the ideas underlying claim networks but were not
          particularly familiar with the tools. These students were assigned
          to the Claim Network group. The remaining three students were
          assigned to the Written Review group and worked with a document
          of about 2300 words in length. It was not 1. What are the disadvantages

          to use the students with knowledge of the principles of claim
          networks to use the tools, since we wished to investigate a scenario
          in which the basic ideas and instrumental operations were known
          (just as members of the Written Review group were familiar with
          reading, pens and paper). Even after deliberately selecting students
          with some knowledge of claim networks the bias of experience
          of the medium used still favours the Written Review group.</p>
        <p>A questionnaire was written which could, in principle, be answered
          using the information provided by either artefact (see Table
          4). A testing station was set up with the Camtasia7 screen capture
          tool to record the participants’ interactions with the tools
          and their verbal comments. While the verbal comments were not
          used heavily in the analysis reported here, the comments of the
          claim network group were a valuable source of qualitiative data
          to understand why they were pursuing particular strategies and
          to identify design flaws and bugs in the interface. Participants
          were accompanied by an observer who could assist with any general
          queries they had about the exercise and who also provided someone
          to ‘‘think aloud’’ to. The questionnaire was presented on screen
          to facilitate timing how long it took to answer each question.
          Camtasia recorded participants as they added or edited their
          answers in this online version and the time taken on each question
          was estimated from verbal comments and time spent inputting answers.
          The Claim Network group was given a Microsoft Internet Explorer
          Web browser with links set up to both ClaiMaker and ClaimFinder.
          The Written Review group had an open Microsoft Word document
          containing the review, plus a hard copy version since many people
          prefer to read on paper.</p>

        <title>5.2.1. The questionnaire and correctness scoring system</title>
        <p>Subjects were required to answer the questions listed in Table
          4. The aim of the questionnaire design was to cover a spread
          of the topics in the domain and to give questions that ranged
          in complexity from extracting facts to demonstrating some understanding
          of the topics. Taking some examples: question 2 concerns the
          topic of link ranking only and simply requires the participant
          to identify some names of algorithms, question 6 concerns both
          scientometrics and the Web and expects the participant to be
          able to identify issues that are problems and question 10 concerns
          all the topics and requires the user to form an overview of them.
          The openness and complexity of the questions tends to increase
          towards the end of the questionnaire to give students the opportunity
          to acquire some knowledge of the domain.</p>
        <p>To assess the correctness of the results, we constructed a ‘‘gold
          standard’’ set of answers by merging the answers of the three
          individuals who tested the questionnaire prior to the study.
          These were the first author, who had access to the review and
          the claim network, the second author, who only used the claim
          network and an experienced research student who was not part
          of the research team, who only used the review. A marking scheme
          was devised and the third author, who was not involved in any
          other part of the evaluation, marked the answer scripts.</p>
        <p>The scoring system was weighted equally across the questions; it
          allotted a maximum of two marks per answer, giving a maximum
          score of 22. For factual questions, a list was supplied of all
          the items listed by the gold standard group in answers and a
          suggested mark was allotted for each item up to a maximum of
          2. Question 2, for example, had half a mark per algorithm up
          to a maximum of 2 marks. The exception was question 7, which
          asks for precisely three properties In this case a bonus half-mark
          was awarded if the participant gave exactly three. For the more
          open questions the marker had to use some discretion and judge
          how well argued the answer was and whether it included reference
          to any of the issues raised by the testers.</p>
        <p>We also recorded the times participants took to answer individual
          questions to determine their relative difficulty. The decision
          of a participant to move from one question to another was a cognitive
          process which could not always be timed with precision. The timings
          were therefore measured in minutes and rounded up. Minutes gave
          sufficient accuracy to get a feel for the relative difficulty
          of questions, which was our main aim. 5.2.2. Results</p>
        <p>Our analysis of the data in the Camtasia movies and the students’
          answers to questions covered several aspects. Correctness and
          actual time taken to answer questions gave us an indication of
          the comparable difficulty of the two tasks (review or claim network).
          The per question analysis of relative time taken and answers
          given helped us understand whether there were affordances of
          the two artefacts which were advantageous in particular situations.
          We gave special attention to the questions which required the
          participants to interpret the material they were given. An analysis
          of how the participants in the Claim Network group used the available
          interfaces informed us about which services were found to be
          most helpful. 5.2.2.1. Task difficulty. Table 5 clearly shows
          that the Written Review group was able to answer the questions
          faster than the Claim Network group. This was to be expected
          for several reasons. First the review has ‘‘added value’’ over
          the claim network: it was written by the researcher based on
          her understanding of the topics built up by constructing the
          claim network. Secondly, members of the Written Review group
          were far more familiar with the medium they were working with
          (essentially a reading comprehension test) than members of the
          Claim Network group. It was observed that all the members of
          the Written Review group used the printed version as their main
          resource and the version on the computer as an occasional look
          up. It would be unreasonable to expect similar ease of use with
          unfamiliar tools in comparison to a skill which the Written Review
          group had been practising for many years. Furthermore, the review
          was quite short, only about 2300 words. This was necessary to
          allow the Written Review group to read it and complete the questionnaire
          under experimental conditions. However, it is possible that if
          the review had been longer (e.g. 23,000 rather than 2300 words)
          the search and exploration services available to the Claim Network
          group would have given them an advantage.
        </p>
        <p>The variability in the times taken by the Claim Network group was
          far greater than for the Written Review group. This seemed to
          be largely due to their personal style of question answering,
          in particular, the slowest participant had a very analytical
          approach to both the questions and the data in the claims.</p>
        <p>We also observed that the Claim Network group generally gave far
          more ‘‘thinking aloud’’ contributions, which was an additional
          distractor and tended to increase actual time to answer questions.
          The reluctance of the Written Review participants to think aloud
          may stem from the strong habit of reading silently. Breaking
          that silence to comment on questions is a barrier.</p>
        <p>Finally, the difference in correctness between the two groups’
          answers was small; the review group scored 1.4 more on average,
          a difference of about 6%. This difference is not particularly
          large, suggesting that the claim network can be understood by
          people other than the creator.</p>

        <p>chart the proportion of question answering time spent for each
          question and in the table the score of each participant on each
          question. For the review participants consideration was given
          to the fairest way to deal with reading time.</p>
        <p>Alternative approaches we considered were: to ignore it and start
          timing at the first point at which the participant started to
          address a question, to divide reading time equally between the
          questions (which seemed intuitively wrong), or to portion out
          the reading time across the questions in proportion to the amount
          of time spent on questions (which results in no change compared
          to ignoring reading time). The decision was complicated by the
          fact that only one of the group began the exercise by reading
          the review all the way through while other two started to answer
          some questions before they had finished reading the whole document.
          Consequently, we decided to opt for the first and simplest method
          which has the additional advantage of being most directly comparable
          with the times for the Claim Network group who did not have a
          reading period.</p>
        <p>These were calculated to remove the effect of personal style; for
          example, within the Claim Network group actual times were very
          variable. Relative time per question provides an indicator as
          to whether members of one group found certain questions relatively
          harder to answer than the other group.</p>
        <p>For most of the questions there is no indication from performance
          times that one group of participants found any question noticeably
          harder than the other group. For question 4 the Written Review
          group found it easier to answer the question than the Claim Network
          group, whereas for questions 7 and 9 the latter completed the
          task in a relatively shorter time. In terms of correctness, only
          question 5 shows a difference between the groups with the review
          group all getting perfect scores and the Network group all scoring
          1 or below. We will look at these three questions in detail.</p>
        <p>The Claim Network group found question 4 (‘‘What is scientometrics?’’)
          relatively harder to answer than the Written Review group. The
          latter had little trouble finding a definition in the first sentence
          of the section of the review headed ‘‘scientometrics’’ and all
          copied this into the answer sheet as ‘‘Scientometrics is the
          study of scientific research literature using citation data’’.
          The Claim Network group took a much more exploratory approach.
          A similar definition had been embedded in the notes field of
          the node labelled ‘‘scientometrics’’. However, none of the Claim
          Network group thought to look for it. They knew that notes existed
          but most of the nodes did not have them and there was no visual
          flag to indicate that this node did (this is a user interface
          design flaw highlighted by the study). Instead they all looked
          at the nodes immediately 438 adjacent to ‘‘scientometrics’’ and
          constructed their answers from those. These produced some acceptable
          definitions, e.g.
        </p>
        <p>From what I understand, scientometrics is a kind of meta-science,
          or a discipline, or a research area, that measures and represents
          ‘discourse’ phenomena within scientific research: for instance,
          providing a picture of how discourse develops in a field, through
          mapping literature (relations between researchers’ work, perspectives,
          concepts, discourse acts like publications, etc.). To use ClaiMaker
          phrasing, it aims at providing evolutionary models of science,
          technology and scholarship.</p>
        <p>This definition certainly reflects the background of the person
          who wrote it (a student of semiotics and discourse) but she has
          clearly formed a personal view of what scientometrics is. To
          summarize, while the process was more time consuming, it could
          be argued that the members of the Claim Network group were forced
          to engage more with the material and understand it, not having
          the option to simply paste the opening sentence conveniently
          found at the start of the Written Review.</p>
        <p>By contrast it was the Written Review group who had trouble with
          question 7 (‘‘Name three properties you would expect to see in
          social networks?’’). The Claim Network group were helped by the
          text of three nodes. They all searched for nodes that contained
          the words ‘‘social networks’’ and got these: ‘‘Social networks
          are assortative’’, ‘‘Social networks have a high degree of clustering’’
          and ‘‘Social networks are divided into groups and communities’’,
          as shown in Fig. 17.</p>
        <p>Two out of three of the Claim Network group turned these directly
          into three properties with which to answer the question. The
          third decided that clusters were similar to groups and searched
          in the neighbourhood of these claims to extract the property:
          ‘‘in social networks connections don’t develop randomly’’.</p>
        <p>The Written Review group had greater difficulty in picking similar
          properties from the text. Each had to spend several minutes reading
          through the section of the text headed ‘‘Social networks’’ and
          one of them reported difficulties with the question. At the end
          each Written Review participant produced a rather different list
          of properties and only one of them gave a set that was similar
          to those reported by the Claim Network group. The Written Review
          group had to interpret several paragraphs of text in order to
          pick out properties whereas the Claim Network group had an easy
          way to answer the question.</p>
        <p>These differences come from the way pieces of information were
          presented in the two artefacts.</p>
        <p>It is of course possible to design either artefact to highlight
          particular information, an issue to which we return in the discussion.
          However, the relative ease with which the Claim Network group
          tackled Question 9 (‘‘Give the titles of two papers which report
          on combining information from Web pages with link analysis algorithms’’)
          stems from the generic affordances of the online system. Each
          Concept is related to a paper whose bibliographic details are
          stored within the system. An icon is presented with each concept
          that allows the user to open up a ‘‘details’’ box with the reference
          in it. Having identified relevant concepts the participants simply
          had to check the details boxes and extract two different titles.
          The review participants had to deal with the familiar difficulties
          of matching a reference marker to the reference itself in a text
          document, although they mitigated this problem by doing text
          searches on authors’ names in their online versions.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, we will look at question 5 (‘‘What does van Raan consider
          to be the sub-tasks of scientometrics?’’), the only question
          for which there was a noticeable difference in scores between
          the two groups. In this case this difference can be explained
          by features in both artefacts. The written review had a bullet
          pointed list summarising van Raan’s analysis. ClaimFinder, on
          the other hand, only had facilities for searching on content
          words not on authors’ names. This had not posed a problem for
          the testers because they were both fluent users of ClaiMaker
          and simply switched over to the ‘‘expert’’ interface to answer
          this question. This difference reveals a design flaw in the novice
          interface that can be corrected by a simple change in how the
          ClaimFinder index is built. 5.2.2.3. Tackling interpretive questions.
          The first nine questions were fact-finding tasks. The last two
          questions required the participants to consider the material
          they had been presented with as a whole. Question 10 (‘‘What
          unifying notion is common to scientometrics, social networks
          studies and link ranking algorithms?’’) required a synthesis
          of ideas encountered in answering the previous nine questions.
          The two groups showed quite different approaches to tackling
          this question. Two of the Claim Network group assumed there was
          some mechanism for tracing a path between concepts in the tool.
          In fact this facility did not exist and they ended up doing extensive
          searches of the neighbourhood of each concept trying to ‘‘manually’’
          identify a Concept that was linked to all of them. One participant
          gave up when he could not find such a concept. The other two
          found the Concept ‘‘Cognitive and socio-organisational structures
          in science and technology’’ which is joined directly to both
          the ‘‘scientometrics’’ and ‘‘social networks’’ Concepts (Fig.
          18). This helped each of them to start formulating an answer.</p>
        <p>The Written Review participants knew there was no ‘‘magic button’’
          they could press and that they would have to generate an answer
          from their own interpretation of the review. Their answers all
          drew on the idea of clustering and communities, ideas which had
          been mentioned in several sections of the review. Thus, on a
          high level, both groups produced answers about the identification
          of patterns, but in slightly different ways.</p>
        <p>Question 11 is perhaps the most fundamental of the questions we
          asked and the most open-ended. Would the participants be able
          to identify open research questions using the information in
          the artefacts? As research students they had all been engaged
          in identifying research questions in their own domains but none
          of them specialized in the specific topics addressed in this
          study. Nor would one normally expect students to start formulating
          research questions after only being exposed to a domain for an
          hour or so. Therefore we did not expect particularly welldeveloped
          replies. We also expected that although the Fig. 18. Identifying
          a bridging concept in the ClaiMaker Neighbourhood visualization,
          in order to find a connection between two research fields (Question
          10). 440 Participant A (Claim Network) B (Claim Network) C (Claim
          Network) D (Written Review) E (Written Review) F (Written Review)
          Research question proposed in response to question 11 I’d have
          a look at the problems or shortcomings identified in one of these
          areas. For instance: I could work on clustering decays and try
          to reduce them. They are an important part of social networks
          and their reduction could increase the deployment of social network.
          Why? Because someone has said that they were an issue for social
          network. So why not tackle it? If my criteria was based on the
          amount of information available, I would have to choose the social
          networks aspect. This seemed to have been the best-covered topic
          in the database. In terms of personal interest and background
          knowledge I would have to choose the scientometrics aspect. The
          aspect I would least likely undertake would be the link ranking
          algorithms since this has a lot of terms that are not very familiar
          and not well defined in the database.</p>
        <p>If I wanted to study social networks on the web, I would try to
          look into the way people use links and express patterns of link
          use (paths). This would interest me because I think it would
          help me to identify people’s thinking, and the way they interpret
          what they find, through the series of connections that they follow.</p>
        <p>Social networks probably because it would inform the others.</p>
        <p>I would be interested in research on social networks that evolve
          over time and that can be used for providing estimations of the
          importance of documents. Social networks and small-networks in
          particular appear to have attracted the interest of many researchers
          from various disciplines.</p>
        <p>
          All of these methods rely on exploiting explicit links between papers.
          What appears to be missing is the reason for the reference. Once
          the network has been built and displayed graphically, it may
          be possible to use deeper NLP techniques to identify types of
          reference. A reference may be given for many reasons such as
          identifying the originator of some notion, theory or claim. A
          reference may be given because the particular work fills a gap
          revealed by another or it contradicts the other claim. It may
          be possible to deduce the nature of the citation on the fly when
          a reader is interested. Alternatively, this could be done for
          each citation which would be computationally expensive, but demonstrate
          different structures such as the genealogy of ideas or controversies,
          etc. answers would be found partly in the material we presented,
          they might also relate to the students’ own characters, interests
          and experience, since researchers’ worldviews affect which questions
          they choose to ask and even find meaningful
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(Reich, 1994)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>As a consequence of these factors we did not expect the participants
          to give similar answers to Question 11. Our aim was first and
          foremost to see if they could give any answers and secondarily
          to make a judgment of how useful their answers were. The answers
          the students gave are presented in Table 6.</p>
        <p>All but one of the participants (D) produced a fairly complex answer.
          Participant D’s answer, ‘‘Social networks probably because it
          would inform the others’’, is certainly not a foolish one. The
          student has realized that the papers researchers choose to cite
          and the pages they choose to make Web links to are partly social
          behaviours and that this could be an interesting thing to look
          at.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the other answers demonstrate misconceptions on the part
          of the participants. For example, in A’s question, the statement
          ‘‘I could work on clustering decays’’ comes from a search to
          look for problems that had been identified in the network as
          a stimulus for forming a research question. This brought up,
          among others the Concept ‘‘clustering coefficient decays with
          time’’, the word ‘‘decays’’ has negative connotations generally,
          but in this case it refers only to the decrease in a numerical
          measure of clustering observed in social networks as they grow.
          While it would be possible to study its causes, it is unlikely
          that the decay could be influenced significantly.</p>
        <p>Errors such as this and our observation of the candidates’ behaviour
          in answering questions leads us to believe that if claim networks
          are to work well great clarity of language will be required.
          For the model we tested, the network contained very little text
          compared to the written review (although it is possible within
          the ScholOnto framework to attach detailed descriptions to nodes).
          This means that the understanding of the participants rested
          heavily on a few words. If there was an ambiguity, or if they
          were unfamiliar with the technical vocabulary in a field they
          could easily form a false opinion. This was less common for the
          Review group. Ambiguity itself is an issue relating to the content
          of the network model rather than any affordances of the tools,
          but there are interesting future challenges in building tools
          which support users in expressing themselves as clearly as possible.</p>
        <p>Participant C makes assumptions about social networks research
          that are not true, probably reflecting her background in hypertext
          which forms a view of what properties a link has.</p>
        <p>The influence of the students’ backgrounds was a strong factor
          in the kinds of questions they chose. For example participant
          E is interested in adaptive algorithms, while F is studying natural
          language processing.</p>
        <p>Four of the participants (A, C, D and F) provide answers which
          go beyond the information in the artefacts.</p>
        <p>They have clearly realized that to formulate a research question
          they will have to go beyond what has already been B 18 9 0 27
          done. Since they are split equally between the two groups it
          can be argued that the claim network was at least as good at
          communicating the information needed to start formulating research
          questions as the review. However the small number of participants
          restricts the generality of conclusions which can be drawn without
          further investigation.

        <title>5.2.2.4. Tool usage patterns in the Claim Network</title>
        <p>group. Finally we used the recordings of the Claim Network group’s
          sessions to assess how the functions of the search tools were
          used. The numbers of search actions performed by the three participants
          were noted and divided into those using three different ClaimFinder
          search interfaces (Find, Discovery and Advanced), those using
          the ClaiMaker system and those using three of the icon links
          illustrated in Fig. 6. Search action data is presented in Table
          7 and Fig. 19. In addition to the actions of the three participants,
          we have included in Table 7 a summary of the search actions of
          an expert user (the second author) who tested the questionnaire
          prior to the main experiment.</p>
        <p>The most heavily used features were the Find search in ClaimFinder
          (18%), a simple search for keywords in concepts and the Anchor
          icon (42%), which selects a concept to be the focus of a Neighbourhood
          search, as described in Section 4.2.3. This pattern of use reflects
          the dominant searching strategy, which was to perform a keyword-based
          search to locate the topic required and then to explore the local
          region of the network.</p>
        <p>All three participants used some of the Discovery and Advanced
          search features in ClaimFinder. This was sometimes because the
          dominant Find/Anchor pattern had failed, but another motivation
          seemed to be simple exploration; as they grew more used to the
          results of the simple Find they explored new techniques.</p>
        <p>Only one participant (A) used any of the ClaiMaker features even
          though all the participants were shown that shortcuts to both
          were given on the toolbar. Participant A was a research student

          had previous experience of using ClaiMaker. He used it briefly
          at the beginning of his session before concentrating on the more
          attractive ClaimFinder interface.</p>
        <p>Participants B and C showed a bias towards using the Concept and
          Document icons, respectively. Both used them mainly for checking
          bibliographic data, which is duplicated in the two places. This
          may merely reflect habits established by early success with one
          method or the other. It perhaps indicates that the two icons
          could be merged to reduce clutter in the display.</p>
        <p>When we compare the actions taken by the three students with those
          of the expert user (Fig. 20) we saw a similar foraging behaviour
          with use of an initial service followed by repeated use of the
          anchor icon for exploration. As would be expected, the expert
          has a much wider repertoire of actions and the initial service
          was not usually the Find service in ClaimFinder. 442 Expert User

        <p>He used the ‘‘unfriendly’’ ClaiMaker a lot more, 22% of actions
          compared to 2% for the students. This may be partly because the
          expert had more than 2 years experience of using ClaiMaker so
          tended to turn to it before the less familiar (to him) ClaimFinder
          interface. However there is evidence that he was exploiting services
          and controlling parameters via the ClaimMaker interface that
          were not available through ClaimFinder. Fig. 21 gives a breakdown
          of the ClaiMaker actions of the expert user and the actions included
          in the ‘‘other’’ category.</p>
        <p>Some of the expert’s ClaiMaker actions mirror the ClaimFinder usage
          of the Claim Network group. He used Neighbourhood six times,
          which gave him the same output as the Find service in ClaimFinder,
          but more control over the parameters he could search for, e.g.,
          he could search for words in the title of an article as well
          as keywords in Concepts. His searches for concepts by keyword
          and IP Owner mirrored the kind of services that can be found
          through the ClaimFinder Advanced menu.</p>
        <p>His use of link tracking (see Fig. 10 and screen movie clip8),
          however, shows him using a service which was not put into ClaimFinder
          because it was considered too complex for a novice user. It gives
          the user a lot of options, including keywords in left- or right-hand
          concepts, specific link types, groups of link types drawn from
          the taxonomy and the depth of search. Having done a linktracking
          search the expert user would then often explore the TouchGraph
          visualization of the results, by clicking the TouchGraph icon,
          a form of presentation which the students did not use heavily.</p>

          major advantage in terms of experience with the artefacts. Both
          groups gave appropriate answers to the questions suggesting that
          the claim network was interpretable by users other than its creator.
          In terms of tool use, the three Claim Network participants concentrated
          mainly on using the simpler functions. However the ClaimFinder
          tool seemed to invite them to use more complex functions as their
          confidence increased. The expert user’s usage patterns suggest
          that, with increased ‘literacy’ with these new tools, users develop

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>New technologies, such as digital libraries, have increased the availability
        of documents dramatically. For researchers this has generated a
        need for better tools to make sense of the many papers they can
        now access. In the Scholarly Ontologies project, we proposed a
        computational approach to support such scholarly sensemaking. Our
        argument is that classical truth maintenance models would not be
        fit for this purpose. Instead the scheme adopted must enable evidence
        to be presented simultaneously in favour of claims and complemented
        by counter-claims. Thus we propose an ontology of rhetorical relations
        for principled agreement and disagreement which can support multiple
        interpretations. This uses a claim network representation to model
        a document’s key contributions and relationships to the literature.
        The network approach has focussed our knowledge modelling effort
        on capturing relationships between objects, rather than simply
        indexing instances of objects. To this end the Scholarly Ontologies
        project has investigated a new kind of digital library server in
        which it would be possible to go beyond searching metadata and
        to ask questions more pertinent to research.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we have presented three related prototype systems
        which have been developed during the project to support users in
        the creation and exploration of claim networks, namely ClaiMaker,
        ClaiMapper and ClaimFinder. We also presented a two-phase evaluation
        study in which a review was made of a multi-disciplinary domain
        during which a claim network was built. Two groups of students,
        one group using a written literature review based on this modelling
        and the other using the claim network itself, answered questions
        about the domain. This case study allowed us to investigate the
        utility of the tools and the approach. The results of the case
        study indicate that the claim network approach presented here can
        support services which address questions like ‘‘where did this
        idea come from?’’ and ‘‘what evidence supports this idea?’’ Furthermore,
        it was observed that as the review progressed the degree of order
        in the models produced in the ClaiMapper interface increased, suggesting
        that it was able to support and reflect back to the analyst, the
        process of conceptual refinement, an important part of sensemaking
        activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The case study has demonstrated that claim networks helped the participants
        to form their own opinions. For instance, the Claim Network participants
        were more inclined than the Written Review group to construct personal
        answers rather than to extract answers from the artefact as if
        they were ‘‘truth’’. Possibly this is because the relative sparseness
        of the network representation forces the user to mentally fill
        in some of the gaps in the information they are presented with,
        or it may simply be that dealing with an unfamiliar representation
        forces the user to think harder, with a richer articulation of
        ideas as a positive sideeffect. While it is beyond the scope of
        this study to speculate further on the cognitive processes of the
        participants, it is worth noting that working with the claim networks
        brought out some different thinking skills in line with positive
        results reported for the use of argument visualization in teaching
        reasoning skills
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Carr, 2003)</xref>
        and for mind mapping in education
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Novak and Gowin, 1984)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we observed a common search strategy in which the students
        using the claim network performed a simple search to locate a node
        with the right keywords in it and then explored the region of claims
        around it, often using the anchor icon to initiate neighbourhood
        searches. This behaviour is typical of the information foraging
        behaviour described by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">Pirolli and Card (1999)</xref>
        . The users are locating what is called an ‘‘information patch’’ and then
        grazing on the information in the patch until either they can answer
        the question to their satisfaction or they have exhausted the information
        there and need to move to a new patch. Although the data from this
        case study is limited to only three users, all of them demonstrated
        foraging behaviour, which is common in information systems generally.
        It seems reasonable to conclude that it was an important way for
        them to interact with these models. The next round of tool development
        should therefore focus on developing the functionality of browsing
        tools and the clarity of their outputs to help users forage as
        effectively as possible. ACT-IF, the formal process model presented
        by Pirolli and Card in their 1999 paper to describe information
        foraging, presents a candidate cognitive modelling approach to
        evaluate new tools or interfaces aimed at supporting browsing.
      </p>
      <p>The sparseness of the representation had disadvantages; when the
        representation was ambiguous it could cause misunderstanding. It
        seems that if claim networks are to be used collaboratively the
        users will have to learn to express themselves precisely, which
        is to say in the terms that their community will understand. Ambiguities
        may also emerge as triggers for debate when communities start working
        together on building networks.</p>
      <p>Finally, while it was demonstrated that the claim networks can convey
        information about a subject domain, we do not claim it is a substitute
        for text. Text allows the author more flexibility in constructing
        the narrative and more influence on the reader because the author
        has control of the order in which information is presented. Our
        observations suggest that our participants could handle information
        in written format faster than using the claim network. That said,
        the prose review and claim network were both relatively small and
        the Claim Network group had much less experience of the medium
        than the Written Review group. It is possible that if the written
        review had been longer and the users of the claim network had more
        experience, it would have been possible to better show the benefits
        of the search services.</p>
      <p>In summary, the ScholOnto research project has been envisioning how
        scholarly knowledge may be published and contested in the future.
        A variety of prototype tools have been developed in our pursuit
        of an environment which would enable analysts to express their
        perspective of the ideas in a literature, which could then be published
        and interrogated as a personal, or shared, model. The evaluation
        reported has taken the first step by demonstrating that given the
        right tool, literature analysis can be assisted by the construction
        of claim networks and that, within the limits of the study reported,
        these networks could effectively convey information to users other
        than their creator. Although the tools we produced support groupworking
        at a technical level, we have not yet studied their synchronous
        or asynchronous use in collaborative environments. We conclude
        that the Scholarly Ontologies approach to sensemaking is worthy
        of further investigation, to improve and further evaluate the tools.</p>
