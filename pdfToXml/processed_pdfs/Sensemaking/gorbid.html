                <p>This paper describes the work undertaken in the Scholarly
                    Ontologies Project. The aim of the project has been
                    to develop a computational approach to support scholarly
                    sensemaking, through interpretation and argumentation,
                    enabling researchers to make claims: to describe and
                    debate their view of a document&apos;s key contributions
                    and relationships to the literature. The project has
                    investigated the technicalities and practicalities
                    of capturing conceptual relations, within and between
                    conventional documents in terms of abstract ontological
                    structures. In this way, we have developed a new kind
                    of index to distributed digital library systems. This
                    paper reports a case study undertaken to test the sensemaking
                    tools developed by the Scholarly Ontologies project.
                    The tools used were ClaiMapper, which allows the user
                    to sketch argument maps of individual papers and their
                    connections, ClaiMaker, a server on which such models
                    can be stored and saved, which provides interpretative
                    services to assist the querying of argument maps across
                    multiple papers and ClaimFinder, a novice interface
                    to the search services in ClaiMaker. r</p>

                <head n="1.">Introduction</head>
                <p>Researchers are benefiting from improved access to documents
                    through digital libraries, electronic journals, eprint
                    archives, etc., but improved access brings its own
                    problems. There is less time to track the growing numbers
                    of conferences, journals and reports they can access.
                    Researchers are interested in questions such as: How
                    does the expert community perceive this theory, model,
                    lan- guage, empirical result? Where did this idea come
                    from? What kind of evidence supports it and challenges
                    it? Are there different schools of thought on this
                    issue? Answers to these kinds of questions arise out
                    of the private sensemak- ing activity which is integral
                    to reading the literature. By 'sensemaking' we refer
                    to
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Weick's (1996)</ref> work on how individuals and groups
                    construct meaning when con- fronted by complex, sometimes
                    contradictory information. We literally 'make sense'
                    by giving form to our evolving understanding of the
                    meaning of data and ideas, as we seek to relate them
                    to our existing conceptual structures, through writing,
                    talking, sketching and other forms of external representation.
                    In the absence of a single canonical view of the world,
                    we must construct 'plausible narratives' to fill in
                    the gaps. Within scholarly discourse, there are accepted
                    ways of establishing (and contesting) plausibility.
                    In this kind of sensemaking, past reading assists the
                    interpretation of related documents which in turn lead
                    the reader on to explore new texts.
                </p>
                <p>In this paper, we describe the prototype tools which have
                    been developed to support sensemaking and report on
                    a case study in which the tools were put to use. In
                    Section 2, we present the aims of the Scholarly Ontologies
                    Project, for which the tools were developed and outline
                    its approach to representing scholarly argument. In
                    Section 3, we pre- sent related work. In Section 4,
                    we describe the tools, ClaiMapper, ClaiMaker and ClaimFinder.
                    In Section 5, we report on the case study. This study
                    had two parts. In the first, ClaiMapper was used to
                    construct a model of a literature as a network of claims.
                    This part was about the use of the tools to record
                    and support sensemaking. In the second part of the
                    study, ClaiMaker and ClaimFinder were used to examine
                    the claim network. This part looked at whether the
                    models could be usefully interpreted by users other
                    than the creator. In Section 6 we reflect on the advantages
                    and limitations of the approach.</p>

                <head n="2.">The Scholarly Ontologies Project</head>
                <p>The Scholarly Ontologies Project was an EPSRC project,
                    funded as part of the programme on Distributed Information
                    Management, with the aim of developing a 'claims server'
                    to support scholarly interpretation and argumentation.
                    It investigated the practicality of publish- ing explicit,
                    semi-formal conceptual structures in a collective knowledge
                    base. These structures are grounded in conventional
                    documents which are accessible, via hyperlinks, directly
                    from the claims server. In this way, the claims server
                    has the additional role of a new kind of index to distributed
                    digital library collections. The system enables researchers
                    to make claims: to describe and debate their view of
                    a document's key contributions and relation- ships
                    to the literature.</p>

                <head n="2.1.">Representing interpretation and argument</head>
                <p>''Ontology'' is the term used in knowledge modelling to
                    describe an abstract specification of concepts, attributes
                    and relationships whose meanings are agreed by the
                    ontology's users
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gruber, 1993)</ref>. Typically, ontologies are applied
                    to control interpretation or semantic annotation in
                    a specific domain, such as travel, enabling interoperability
                    between, for instance, airline and hotel booking sites.
                </p>
                <p>In contrast, we propose an ontology not only to represent
                    consensus, but also principled disagreement, which
                    can support multiple interpretations. These might be
                    different interpretations of the claims in a single
                    paper or between a number of papers. The resolution
                    of the apparent contradiction between the use of ontologies
                    to control interpretation and our use of an ontology
                    to represent multiple interpretations comes from the
                    observa- tion that, while researchers do not necessarily
                    agree on the issues under debate, the mechanisms of
                    scholarly debate do remain stable over time. Whether
                    research is in the arts or sciences, there will always
                    be problems that are of key interest, people will put
                    forward theories, predictions, hypotheses, etc., and
                    try to support them with data and analysis. These contributions
                    may, in their turn, be challenged or developed further.
                    In order to tackle the problem of multiple interpretations,
                    our knowledge mod- elling effort has focused on capturing
                    these enduring, discipline-independent relationships
                    between objects, which we call discourse relations,
                    rather than the types of objects. This and other requirements
                    for the ontology required for representing scholarly
                    debate in a claims server are outlined in
                    <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.
                </p>
                <p>The base form of the representation is a directed graph
                    in which Concepts form the nodes and the links are
                    drawn from a taxonomy of discourse relations. Concepts
                    are stored as short pieces of free text succinctly
                    summarising a contribution, at whatever granularity
                    the researcher wishes. A claim is a triple of two such
                    objects connected by a link
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1</ref>). Other objects which may be used as
                    nodes in claims include sets (collections of concepts)
                    and claims themselves.
                </p>
                <p>Within the ontology we have a taxonomy of link types to
                    represent the rhetoric of researchers when they present
                    their arguments (see
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>). Relations are classified into groups
                    with similar rhetorical implications: Supports/ Challenges,
                    Problem Related, Taxonomic, Causal, Simi- larity and
                    General. Each relation belongs to exactly one of these
                    groups. Some of these groups, such as Supports/ Challenges
                    and Problem Related enable the user to take positions.
                    Others, particularly the Causal and Taxonomic relations,
                    support the building of models of domains for arguments
                    to refer to. These are not argumentation relations.
                    However, we discovered that they were necessary to
                    allow users to provide supporting material to make
                    their arguments comprehensible. It can be argued that
                    these two categories of groups should be split at a
                    higher level of the taxonomy into relations about content
                    and relations about positions. However we have not
                    followed this route in the version presented here.
                    The design and evolution of the ontology is described
                    by Buckingham
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Shum et al. (2002)</ref>. Its theoretical relationship
                    to discourse relations theory, specifically Cognitive
                    Coherence Relations theory, is detailed in
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mancini (2005)</ref>.
                    <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Each relation is identified by a natural language
                    label. This can be changed for communities with different
                    rhetorical styles helping us tackle requirements 1
                    and 6 in
                    <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.
                </p>
                <p>Each relation is assigned two properties: a polarity which
                    indicates whether it has positive or negative implications
                    (e.g. the label proves has positive polarity whereas
                    refutes has negative polarity; it implies disproof)
                    and a weight (high or low) which indicates how forceful
                    it is (e.g. refutes is more forceful than disagreesWith).
                    The assignment of polarity allows us to tackle requirement
                    2 in

                <p>2 Cognitive Coherence Relations theory is derived from
                    research into coherence relations in text and speech.
                    Approaches in these fields such as Discourse Representation
                    Theory (DRT)
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kamp, 1981)</ref> focus on modelling formally sentential
                    relationships and sub-structure, but this is too fine
                    a granularity to expect from users except trained discourse
                    analysts. Approaches such as DRT might be used to analyse
                    the content of concepts in claims.

                    level of nesting allowed users to build complex arguments,
                    while mitigating the implementation difficulties posed
                    by fully recursive structures. Later in the prototyping
                    cycle an extension of Sets was implemented which allows
                    an element of a Set to be another Set or a claim. This
                    allows more deeply nested structures to be built.</p>
                <p>A concept may be assigned a type (e.g. /DataS /EvidenceS
                    /HypothesisS). However typing of concepts is optional
                    (although in a pedagogical context it might be appropriate
                    to enforce concept typing as a way to lead students
                    to think more carefully about their claims). Optional
                    typing is unusual in ontologies but is motivated

                    structure should be based on a noun/verb metaphor with
                    the relations taking the role of verbs. Making arguments
                    in pseudo-natural language was intended to make the
                    scheme intuitive for contributors.

                <p>2. Permit the expression of dissent: A classical truth
                    maintenance model would not be fit for purpose; if
                    ''truth'' is established on an issue, it ceases to
                    be worth doing research about. The scheme must therefore
                    be closer to that presented by
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Toulmin (1958)</ref>, with evidence being presented
                    in favour of claims and complemented by counter-claims.
                    To support or challenge a claim, the modeller uses
                    relations with either positive or negative polarity.
                    The concept of polarity is drawn from the work of Knott
                    and Mellish on Cognitive Coherence Relations (CCR)
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Knott and Mellish, 1996)</ref>. To agree with a proposition,
                    the relation used would have positive polarity. To
                    disagree it would have negative polarity. Giving relations
                    polarity opens up the possibility of providing services
                    at a higher level of granularity than that of individual
                    link labels. See
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mancini and Buckingham Shum (2004)</ref> and
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Uren et al. (2004)</ref> for further discussion on
                    CCR.
                </p>
                <p>3. Signal the ownership of public content: Contributors
                    must take responsibility for the claims they make because
                    we depend on the social control of peer pressure to
                    motivate high quality claim making. Although a peer-reviewing
                    process could be conceived we have not attempted one
                    in the early prototypes. Ownership also has a key role
                    in the claims server as digital library server: claims
                    would be ''backed up'' by a link to a published paper.
                    There is an analogy here with Toulmin's warrants.</p>
                <p>4. Accommodate the social dimensions to being explicit:
                    Argument modelling invites researchers to consider
                    making explicit what is normally implicit in the text
                    of a paper (discussed in Buckingham
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Shum et al., 2000</ref>). Consider a relation refutes.
                    This is a forceful term and therefore should carry
                    greater weight in calculations than, for example, takes
                    issue with. From the social side, some contributors
                    might prefer to use the less extreme term when linking
                    to concepts created by eminent figures. Providing these
                    soft options recognises the social dimensions to citation,
                    and aims to remove a possible barrier to adoption.
                </p>
                <p>5. Assign concepts no category outside of use: We require
                    that the typing of object should be optional and that
                    objects may change their type depending on the context.
                    A key precept of conventional approaches to ontologies
                    is that objects in a scheme are typed under one or
                    more classes. While this is acceptable for non-controversial
                    attributes such as Software, this cannot be sustained
                    when we are talking about the role that a concept plays
                    in multiple arguments. The concept that is a Problem
                    under debate in one paper may be an Assumption in another
                    (or even within the same paper). The scheme must therefore
                    allow the same concept to take on several types in
                    different situations.</p>
                <p>6. Assist in making connections across disciplinary boundaries:
                    We are trying to identify a core set of argumentation
                    relations that are useful in many disciplines. However,
                    the precise terms used for making a case will differ
                    from one research community to another. We tackle this
                    using the idea of dialects. Drawing again on Cognitive
                    Coherence Relations (see 2.), we define a core set
                    of relational classes, with properties such as type,
                    polarity and weight, but these may be reified with
                    natural language labels in many ways. For instance,
                    a community in which it would be strange or unacceptable
                    to refute someone's work could change the label to
                    something they felt more comfortable with (e.g. raises
                    serious questions), but the basic properties of the
                    strongly negative relation that challenges a concept
                    would remain unchanged. This method would let us configure
                    claim servers for different communities without altering
                    the underlying reasoning engine. by the observation,
                    made in requirement 5 of
                    <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, that objects may play different roles
                    in different contexts, since researchers may disagree
                    on the node's type: e.g. is this Language also a Theory?
                    Is this based on Opinion or Data? One person's underlying
                    Theory may be someone else's Problem. An author may
                    even problematize an idea later on in a text, which
                    she has up to that point treated as an unproblematic
                    Theory, Language, etc. Our approach, therefore, is
                    that if a type is assigned it is stored as part of
                    the link connecting it to another concept rather than
                    as an intrinsic part of the concept. This has the effect
                    of making node-typing context dependent and thus permits
                    multiple typing of the same concept in different relations.
                    We also argue that for some relations typing the concepts
                    is redundant since the role of the nodes is implied
                    by the relation type. The link types is evidence for,
                    which implies the left-hand node is a piece of evidence
                    and addresses, which implies the right-hand side is
                    a problem and the left a remedy, are examples of this
                    behaviour.
                </p>
                <p>The cost of this approach is that removing any compulsion
                    on users to type their concepts does reduce the level
                    of detail of analysis possible. Here we chose to trade
                    off computational power against cognitive load on users
                    and produced a ''good enough'' representation. We envisage
                    that certain communities might want to comple- ment
                    the discourse ontology with their own specialist vocabularies,
                    particularly where these are widely used; for example,
                    a biomedical version might need to type concepts that
                    are genes, enzymes, proteins, etc. However domain specific
                    extensions of this type were not attempted in the generic
                    prototype discussed in this paper.</p>
                <p>To illustrate discourse ontology links in use, we will
                    examine some claim triples based on arguments presented
                    in Borodin et al.'s paper ''Finding Authorities and
                    Hubs From Link Structures on the World Wide Web''.
                    3 These claims were produced by the first author during
                    the modeling phase of the case study reported in Section
                    5 and are also presented in

                <p>The first claim triple (A in
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>) uses a link with type General and label

                    This sort of relationship tends to be indicated quite
                    early in papers when authors are indicating the domain
                    they are addressing. For example, the abstract of Borodin
                    et al.'s paper starts with the sentence ''Recently,
                    there have been a number of algorithms proposed for
                    analyzing hypertext link structure so as to determine
                    the best ''authorities'' for a given topic or query''.
                    They are helpful in Claim networks as the topic node
                    gives an entry point for browsing.

                <p>2.1.2. ''TKC effect-algorithm favours tight knit communities''
                    ''is different to'' ''SALSA behaviour- algorithm mixes
                    authorities from different communities''</p>
                <p>The second triple (B in
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>) uses a link labeled is different to with
                    type Similarity and negative polarity. It expresses
                    a negative similarity relation, i.e. it says that ''TKC
                    effect'' and ''SALSA behaviour'' are not the same.
                    In the original paper, one of the places where this
                    claim is expressed reads as follows: ''Specifically,
                    when computing the top authorities, the Kleinberg algorithm
                    tends to concentrate on a ''tightly knit community''
                    of nodes (the TKC effect), while SALSA tends to mix
                    the authorities of different communities in the top
                    authorities''.

                <p>2.1.3. ''TKC effect-algorithm favours tight knit communities''
                    ''is capable of causing'' ''topic drift''</p>
                <p>The third triple (C in
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>) uses a link with type Causal and the
                    label is capable of causing. One of the sources for
                    this claim in the paper reads: ''ythese examples seem
                    indicative of the topic drift potential of the principal
                    eigenvector in the Kleinberg algorithm''. This is an
                    example of how the discourse ontology constrains the
                    modeler, here to make a claim which is rather stronger
                    than that in the original paper. How should we read
                    causal statements in Scholonto? We have stated that
                    we wish to deal with models of the arguments people
                    make, rather than propositions about the world (see
                    requirement 2). Yet this claim looks on the surface
                    like a proposition that could take a truth-value. However,
                    if we add in the metadata stored for claims about the
                    creator and backing paper, the claim could be read
                    as: Uren states, that Kleinberg claims, that ''TKC
                    effect-algorithm favours tight knit commu- nities''
                    is capable of causing ''topic drift''. The claim as
                    a whole is able to be used as a node within other claims;
                    for example, a claim about a (hypothetical) rebuttal
                    made by Kleinberg or another reader/modeller's interpretation
                    of the same text.
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> shows the three claims above in the context
                    of the claim network in which they were created. The
                    arrange- ment is dominated by the claim highlighted
                    in the centre of the model: ''TKC effect-algorithm
                    favours tightly knit communities'' is different to
                    ''SALSA behaviour-algo- rithm mixes authorities from
                    different communities''. This claim summarizes the
                    two key phenomena explored in Borodin's paper. Below
                    this line are arranged the algorithms investigated,
                    each linked to the phenomenon or phenomena it can cause.
                    Above this line the more general information is placed,
                    these links set the work in context and link one of
                    the phenomena, causally, to a problem, labeled ''topic
                    drift''. Within the private world of ClaiMapper, the
                    relative position of concepts can be used in this way
                    to assist sensemaking interaction with the paper. However
                    it is not transferred to the server, which stores only
                    connectivity information since it merges models from
                    many papers and many users which may have overlaps.

                <head n="3.1.">Hypertext</head>
                <p>It is widely recognized that hypertext was shaped by the
                    Memex vision of Bush (1945) and the NLS system of
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Engelbart (1962)</ref>. It is less commonly known that
                    both of these pioneers saw the construction and analysis
                    of scholarly arguments as key applications of their
                    technol- ogies, as discussed in Buckingham Shum (2003).
                    The work described here can thus be traced back to
                    Bush and Engelbart, via the extensive research in the
                    1980s and early 1990s into hypertext graphical argumentation
                    tools and more recent work on scholarly hypermedia
                    (for a review see Buckingham ). Bush proposed the idea
                    of ''associative trails'', or chains of documents linked
                    by associations similar to the associations in human
                    memory. We propose ScholOnto claim networks as a method
                    of signposting these trails through a document collection
                    such as the Internet. This progression from the closed
                    pre-Web argumentation systems to the Internet increases
                    the scale of the user community proportionally.

                <p>Recent years have seen the early stages of the develop-
                    ment of the Semantic Web, in which web pages with machine
                    interpretable mark up provide the source material with
                    which agents and semantic web services operate
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Berners-Lee et al., 2001</ref>). The commentary offered
                    by the ScholOnto approach could be viewed as a form
                    of semantic annotation of documents. The W3C annotation
                    project Annotea (
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kahan et al., 2001</ref>) and CREAM
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Handschuh and Staab, 2002</ref>), an annotation framework
                    being devel- oped at the University of Karlsruhe, offer
                    alternative infrastructures for managing mark-up of
                    this kind. Annotea applies the W3C open standards for
                    annotating XML and HTML documents and assumes the Web
                    as the environment. CREAM applies the same standards
                    but is aimed a knowledge management environment, such
                    as company intranets, where a lot of data may be stored
                    in databases or other non-web-native forms and where
                    more control of annotation quality may be desired (and
                    possible).

                <head n="3.3.">Concept mapping</head>
                <p>The use of familiar metaphors is essential when presenting
                    new technologies to users to reduce the barrier to
                    uptake. In designing the representational scheme for
                    the Scholarly Ontologies project we sought familiar
                    sensemak- ing methods that link ideas. The Mind Maps
                    developed by
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Buzan (1989)</ref> are well established as a sensemaking
                    method in education and business. Mind Maps typically
                    have the main topic in the centre of the map with subtopics
                    and sub- subtopics radiating off like seeds on the
                    head of a dandelion. However the focus on a central
                    concept is too restricting a practice for sensemaking
                    in research litera- tures, where people may explore
                    several inter-related topics and so the fundamentally
                    hierarchical Mind Map method would not be appropriate.
                    Therefore we took an approach which is more akin to
                    the concept mapping method proposed by
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Novak and Gowin (1984)</ref>. In concept mapping the
                    concepts are linked into networks, rather than hierarchies,
                    giving more freedom to express the interrelations between
                    ideas. The notion of labelling links, which is widely
                    used in concept mapping, is also important. However,
                    because we wanted to be able to construct services
                    using our links, we needed to have a degree of control
                    over the kinds of links modellers would use and support
                    the reuse of structures via a server.

                <head n="3.4.">Link vocabularies</head>
                <p>In developing this vocabulary of link types we were aware
                    of a trade-off between usability and expressiveness.
                    Users may be wary of a very complex system, preferring
                    not to use it rather than be seen to make a ''mistake''.
                    On the other hand very simple systems impose too many
                    constraints on the types of models users can build.
                    Therefore while we drew on theoretical work such as
                    that on Cognitive Coherence Relations (
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Knott and Mellish, 1996;</ref>
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Knott and Sanders, 1998</ref>) we took a pragmatic
                    approach to selecting relations, aiming for a moderate
                    palette of useful links rather than a very complete
                    set such as that proposed by
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Trigg (1983)</ref>. Since then Gil and Ratnakar have
                    published work on the TRELLIS system (
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gil and Ratnakar, 2002</ref>) which also uses discourse
                    relations. We note that they too selected relations
                    that could be understood by users, rather than ''precise''
                    or ''complete'' relations. Selected examples of discourse
                    relations used in Trellis include: provides background
                    for, in contrast with, is solved by, is motivation
                    for, depends on and causes.

                <head n="3.5.">Citation classification</head>
                <p>There are parallels between the typing of links and the
                    typing of citations. Since citation databases first
                    became available authors have proposed systems for
                    categorising authors' motives and/or the rhetorical
                    role citations play, e.g.
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lipetz (1965)</ref>,
                    <ref type="bibr">Weinstock (1971)</ref>,
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murugesan and Moravcsik (1978)</ref>,
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Duncan et al. (1981)</ref> and
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Garzone and Mercer (2000)</ref>. While these schemes
                    are varied they share common elements, such as corroborating/affirmative,
                    negational/correcting, methodology, background/assumed
                    knowledge, which we recognize also among the relational
                    types of our own ontology and Gil's. We are convinced
                    that citation indexes would be greatly improved by
                    this kind of typing and are investigating its application
                    in other projects. However to be economic it must be
                    automated and this is a substantial challenge for natural
                    language researchers. Much of the automatic classification
                    of citations carried out to date has been aimed at
                    document summarisation and argumentative zoning (finding
                    the parts of papers that play different roles) rather
                    than directly at citation classification, e.g. Nanba
                    and Okumura (1999) and
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Teufel and Moens (2000)</ref>. It is an interesting
                    observation that these authors employ very basic categorisation
                    schemes of just three or four key types. Nanba and
                    Okumura have Type B-the references to base on other
                    researchers' theories or methods, Type C-the references
                    to compare with related works or to point out their
                    problems, Type O-the references other than types B
                    and C, whereas Teufel and Moens have Background, Other
                    work, Weakness/Contrast and Own contribution. By contrast,
                    Mercer et al. are investigating textual cues to mark
                    up a two tier system with 34 base types divided between
                    10 upper categories (
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mercer and Di Marco, 2004</ref>).
                </p>
                <p>We are convinced that citation indexes would be greatly
                    improved by this kind of typing. Although at present,
                    it is fair to say that these techniques are still in
                    a relatively early state of development. Apart from
                    providing an automated technique to apply to a specific
                    document corpus (once properly trained), the key difference
                    to our approach is that the granularity of our work
                    is the claim, as opposed to the document. The complementarity
                    between the two ap- proaches hold potential, however,
                    and
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sereno et al. (2005)</ref> have reported the evaluation
                    of a prototype system which applies

                    and other information extraction techniques to more
                    actively support the task of detecting and annotating,
                    potentially significant claims in documents.

                <head n="4.">The tools</head>
                <p>Three prototype tools were used in the case study reported
                    in Section 5 of this paper. The first is ClaiMapper,
                    a sketching tool that supports users in making sense
                    of the claims in papers. When the user is satisfied
                    with part or entire claim network produced in ClaiMapper
                    it can be imported into the second tool ClaiMaker.
                    This is a digital library server that connects claims
                    via hyperlinks to the documents they describe and provides
                    search services to help users explore large claim networks.
                    The third tool is ClaimFinder. This is an alternative
                    interface to Claim- Maker, designed for use by novices,
                    which contains the simpler search functions presented
                    more accessibly.</p>
            </div>
            <div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">

                <head n="4.1.">ClaiMapper argument sketching tool</head>
                <p>The first prototype for building claim networks was a form-filling
                    interface which can be accessed directly through the
                    ClaiMaker server. This interface has one form to create
                    Concepts, another to create Sets and a variety of forms
                    for creating different kinds of Claims. This was a
                    quick route to allow the research team to start populating
                    the database with claims in order to put the ontology
                    through its paces and create a collection for testing
                    services, but it did not provide much sensemaking support
                    to modellers. For instance, while the project team
                    did become adept at choosing from among the many options
                    on the interface, they reported difficulty holding
                    a gestalt view of the model in their heads as they
                    went through the dissociated steps of building Concepts
                    and Sets, then assembling them into Claims. It was
                    clear that some radical changes were needed to the
                    interface if it was to support the cognitive processes
                    involved in creating claim networks.</p>
                <p>In order to overcome the problems of holding complex models
                    in memory, the project team sometimes found themselves
                    resorting to pen and paper for sketching out drafts
                    of argument maps. An extreme example showing a paper-based
                    concept network describing several papers is shown
                    in
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>: each sheet of paper has a sketch of the
                    claims in one paper, the arrows drawn between sheets
                    on the white board represent claims which use concepts
                    from two different papers. This sketching stage was
                    adopted in part because the form-filling interface
                    had no correction facility. It prevented users from
                    deleting or modifying a concept which might meanwhile
                    have been included in someone else's model. However
                    it was mainly driven by a desire to refine the user's
                    own interpretation before committing it to the knowledge
                    base. In the terms of Green's cognitive dimensions
                    analysis the interface was ''enforcing premature structure''
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Green, 1990;</ref>
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Shipman and Marshall, 1999</ref>), by making the users
                    commit a structure before they were comfortable that
                    they had made sense of what they were reading.
                </p>
                <p>It was clear that a new interface should offer better support
                    for this sketching stage, which enables the refinement
                    part of the sensemaking process. It therefore had to
                    assist the process of sketching draft maps and reviewing
                    new structures in context before committing them to
                    the knowledge base. This was implemented by modifying
                    Compendium, a hypertext visual modelling tool.
                    <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The result was a desktop sketching tool called
                    ClaiMapper in which a small number of icon conventions
                    are used to produce visualisations of concepts and
                    the connections between them.
                </p>
                <p>The ClaiMapper conventions are illustrated in
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref>. The right pane is an open document that
                    contains two concepts (represented by the orb icon)
                    and a set, which contains two other concepts (represented
                    by the bullet list icon with the subscript 2 indicating
                    the number of concepts contained in the set). These
                    are linked to form two Claim triples. A Claim triple
                    comprises two objects joined by a directed, labelled
                    link. We refer to the objects convention- ally as the
                    left-and right-hand objects, the left hand being the
                    place the link comes from and the right hand the place
                    it links to. Of the claims in
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref>, one has on the left hand the set and
                    on the right hand one of the concepts linked by the
                    relation is analogous to. The second claim has on the
                    left hand the concept labelled One Claim can contain
                    another and on the right hand the whole of the first
                    Claim triple (represented by the is similar to link
                    pointing to the centre of the is analogous to link).
                    Using ClaiMapper in this way we can clearly visualize
                    the nesting described in Section 2.1.

                    of informal structure that are helpful to the organisation

                    can edit the structures they build at will. However
                    in order to access the interpretational services provided
                    by ClaiMaker they will eventually have to decide that
                    their interpretation of a particular document is ''good
                    enough'' to be uploaded to a private or shared database.
                    At this point the structures that have been uploaded
                    are synchro- nized with the server by being given unique
                    IDs (see
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 15b</ref>, IDs are numbers in angle brackets).
                    Subsequently ClaiMapper prevents editing of those structures,
                    for example, changing a label, which would cause a
                    mismatch with the server version. The user is still
                    free to link to them, in which case the additional
                    claims can be uploaded to the server. Structures can
                    also be deleted from the ClaiMapper version, since
                    the server version does not require users to have a
                    full copy of the server model on their local machine
                    it will not detect an error. The user can also download
                    their own and other modellers' structures from the
                    server for use in ClaiMapper.

                <head n="4.2.">ClaiMaker server software</head>
                <p>The ClaiMaker server combines a number of roles. It supports
                    model building, through the original form-based interface
                    and through model upload via XML files exported by
                    ClaiMapper. It also provides a range of search, visualisation
                    and discovery services. Implementing ClaiMaker as a
                    server application has a number of practical advantages.
                    In the development stage it facili- tated getting new
                    versions to early adopters; changes made to the server
                    are available to users without them having to regularly
                    update their local software. It also gave the project
                    team access to the models people built allowing us
                    to assess the modeling scheme and identify difficulties.
                    Uploading claims once to a server is a much easier
                    way for a distributed group of collaborators to share
                    their annotations than circulating files of annota-
                    tions which each member of the group must upload individually
                    to view them. Finally, to support ClaiMaker's role
                    as a digital library system, the choice of a server,
                    in which links can be made to digital resources via
                    URLs, is obvious.</p>
                <p>The data (Concepts, Sets, Claims, bibliographic metada-
                    ta, etc.) are stored in a MySQL database which underlies
                    all the functions. A mirror of the database in RDF
                    was also maintained at one stage on a Lisp server.
                    This allowed us to experiment with services that exploited
                    the structure in the link ontology to a greater extent.
                    We were able to develop some interesting services using
                    this technology, e.g., lineage, which will be discussed
                    further below. However, we found that the technical
                    difficulties of maintaining two intercommunicating
                    servers were too great for us (and probably for potential
                    users as well). Consequently we found ways to recast
                    these services as complex SQL statements that replicate
                    most of the functionality of the RDF-based search.</p>
                <p>We will not describe the model building functions of ClaiMaker,
                    since the form-based interfaces it uses have been largely
                    superseded by the sketching technology used in ClaiMapper.
                    We will concentrate instead on the search, visualisation
                    and discovery functions. Later we will demonstrate
                    how some of these functions were used to analyse the
                    claim network produced using ClaiMapper. </p>

                <head n="4.2.1.">Search</head>
                <p>ClaiMaker has a basic set of services that allow the user
                    to find documents, concepts, sets and links by searching
                    for title text, author, creator, creation date, etc.
                    As a first step these give tabular listings of the
                    type shown in Figs. 6 and 7. From these listings further
                    information about the objects returned can be found
                    using the icons located with them. These open supplementary
                    information boxes that overlay the main listing. Working
                    from left to right on the concepts in
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref> the ''i'' icon will bring up further information
                    about the concept itself (who created it, when, any
                    further details input by the creator, etc.). The ''anchor''
                    icon sets this concept as the focal node in a Neighbourhood
                    search (described shortly). The document node gives
                    the biblio- graphic details of the document that backs
                    the concept up and a hyperlink to the original. The
                    final ''person'' icon gives details of the person who
                    created the object.
                </p>
                <p>The listing for links (see
                    <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>) shows for each claim the two objects
                    that are joined in the first and third columns with
                    an arrow icon between them. The same icon set is used
                    to access additional information and the colour of
                    the arrow depends upon the properties of the link so
                    that red links represent links with negative polarity
                    and green links have strong weight and positive polarity
                    (the rest are gold). Referring back to
                    <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, ''improves on'' is shown with a green
                    arrow, ''is different to'' with a red arrow and less
                    strongly negative/positive relations such as ''is evidence
                    for'', ''addresses'' and ''is about'' with gold arrows.

                <head n="4.2.2.">Visualisation</head>
                <p>In addition to the tabular layout search results which
                    contain claims can be viewed using interactive views
                    generated using the TouchGraph 5 visualisation package.
                    For example
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8</ref> is a TouchGraph rendering of search results.
                    The visualisation can be explored by the user via the
                    locality, zoom and rotate functions, or filtered by
                    link type using the menu shown. Further information
                    on nodes in the display can be accessed by hovering
                    over a node and selecting ''details'', as shown.

                <head n="4.2.3.">Discovery</head>
                <p>Developing discovery services has been a core activity
                    within the Scholarly Ontologies project. Traditional
                    information retrieval systems use term-based search
                    and search via citations. Term-based search handles
                    documents as isolated entities defined by the words
                    in them. Citations in a document do give an indication
                    of the links between documents but there are many motives
                    for citing and a reference list gives no indication
                    of authors' intentions in referring to other work.
                    We generally cannot even tell if a paper is referenced
                    because the authors support it or are diametrically
                    opposed to it, although interesting research is being
                    done to improve this situation (see Section 3).</p>
                <p>In this section, we describe four of the discovery services
                    that we have developed. The examples of discovering
                    the neighbourhood and discovering chains, demonstrate
                    ser- vices to assist the user in exploring and navigating
                    the topologies of argument maps. The examples of discovering
                    disagreement and discovering lineage demonstrate how
                    the explicit connections embedded in the discourse
                    ontology can be used to build services that assist
                    the user in answering common research questions, e.g.
                    ''Where did this idea come from?'' A typical discovery
                    service comprises a search of the claims network followed
                    by a presentation of results (which may be a visualisation)
                    tailored to the particular question.</p>
                <p>4.2.3.1. Discovering the neighbourhood. The Neighbour-
                    hood search, which can be reached from tabular results
                    listings via the anchor icon gives answers to the question
                    ''What is directly related to this?'' It allows the
                    user to examine all the claims made with one or more
                    chosen object/s on either the left-or the right-hand
                    side. The focal concepts can be searched for using
                    a keyword search, or a search for all the concepts
                    in a particular paper, or by picking up an anchor icon
                    from a previous results listing, or by picking up an
                    anchor icon from one of the left-or right- hand column
                    headings in the neighbourhood table which selects all
                    the concepts in that column as focal concepts. The
                    focal concepts are listed in the central column of
                    the neighbourhood listing (see
                    <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>). Because it embeds the anchor icon in
                    its own results listing (see
                    <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>), the neighbourhood service allows users
                    to step through complex networks following routes that
                    are interesting to them.

                <head n="4.2.3.3.">Discovering disagreement.</head>
                <p>Consider a common question that many researchers bring
                    to a literature: ''What arguments are there against
                    this paper?'' Despite the centrality of the notion
                    of disagreement in the assessment of evidence, there
                    is not even a language in which to articulate such
                    a query to a digital library. With our ontology modelling
                    the world of scholarly discourse, we can begin to express
                    the basic idea that researchers disagree; it is the
                    idea embedded in the property negative polarity.</p>
                <p>How can we operationalize such a query? First, we are looking
                    for arguments against, which map on to the ontology
                    as relations of any type with negative polarity. At
                    a trivial level, this paper corresponds to the currently
                    selected document in ClaiMaker. But more substantively,
                    this paper refers to the claims that researchers have
                    made about the document, specifically, the concepts
                    linked to it. Moreover, we can extend this to related
                    concepts, using the following definition: the extended
                    set of concepts linked by a positive relation to/from
                    the document's immediate concepts, i.e., discovering
                    chains of disagreement or agreement.</p>
                <p>For the given document, this discovery service does the
                    following:</p>
                <p>1. Finds the concepts associated with that paper. 2. Extends
                    the set of concepts by adding positively linked concepts
                    from other papers. 3. Finds concepts that link to these
                    with negative relations. 4. Returns the concepts from
                    step 3 as concepts against the extended concept set.</p>
                <p>This approach has dangers. It does not follow that if A
                    is in agreement with B and B is in disagreement with
                    C then A must be in disagreement with C also. However
                    it should be remembered that this is a search service.
                    It is up to the user to judge whether the claims returned
                    are valid.</p>
                <p>Typical results are presented in
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>. Note the two numbers to the right of
                    the claim that disagrees with one of the related issues
                    in the query. The first (8621) is a hyperlink to the
                    metadata of the paper that provides the backing for
                    the claim, which includes a URL to the paper itself.
                    The second (2) is a link to the personal details of
                    the modeller who made the claim; this allows the user
                    to make a judgement about the credentials of the claim:
                    can it be trusted?
                </p>
                <p>4.2.3.4. Discovering lineage. A common activity in re-
                    search is clarifying where a particular idea came from
                    and what other ideas influenced its development. We
                    call this the lineage behind an idea. Lineage is the
                    notion that ideas build on each other and has an inverse,
                    the descendant, which is the notion that ideas are
                    spawned by a particular seminal notion. Where the paths
                    have become increasingly indirect over time or been
                    confused, uncovering unexpected or surprising lineage
                    is a major scholarly contribution. We have a more modest
                    goal to start with in ClaiMaker: to provide a tool
                    pick out from the 'spaghetti' of claims, candidate
                    streams of ideas that conceptually appear to be building
                    on each other.</p>
                <p>In practice, our lineage tool tracks back (semantically,
                    not in time) from a concept to see how it evolved,
                    whereas the descendants tool tracks forward from a
                    concept to see what new ideas evolved from it. Since
                    descendants are the inverse of lineage (and are implemented
                    as its literal inverse) we will only discuss lineage.
                    A lineage can be conceptualized as a path in which
                    the links suggest development or improvement
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 12)</ref>.

                <p>The constraints are chosen to reflect the ideas of improvement
                    and development. The set of permitted link types comprises
                    the two general links uses/applies/is enabled by or
                    improves on and links of type similarity and positive
                    polarity. The improves on link type is included to
                    reflect the notion of improvement, while uses/applies/is
                    enabled by has the weaker implication of development.
                    The similarity links are included because if a new
                    concept is like a second that improves on a third concept,
                    then the new concept is likely to be an improvement
                    on the third concept as well. The problem of finding
                    lineage in ClaiMaker can then be formulated as a path-matching
                    problem, a well- known problem in graph theory, which
                    searches for paths (sequences) of links that follow
                    a specific pattern. The first prototype of the lineage
                    service used an RDF representa- tion of the argument
                    maps and the Ivanhoe path matcher embedded in the Wilbur

                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lassila, 2001</ref>). This approach is described in
                    our other papers: Buckingham Shum et al.
                    <ref type="formula">(2003)</ref> and
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Uren et al. (2003)</ref>. Due to operational difficulties
                    with supporting a Lisp server in parallel with the
                    ClaiMaker server this approach was later dropped and
                    we adopted a slightly weaker approach to lineage based
                    on a chain search with the links going away from the
                    home node, pruned using constraints based on the link
                    ontology. The descendants algorithm is the same except
                    that the links in the chain are directed towards the
                    home node.
                </p>
                <p>The procedure is as follows:</p>
                <p>(1) The user inputs a home node H and a number of steps
                    N, the maximum length of lineage they wish to search
                    through. (2) Find all links in the direction away from
                    H (H is the left-hand side of the triple) that meet
                    the set of Two things were lost in the MySQL implementation,
                    compared to the first RDF-based prototype. The first
                    is that we can no longer handle similarity links as
                    symmetric links, i.e. we can no longer ignore their
                    direction. The second is that, because MySQL has poor
                    facilities for recursion by comparison with Lisp, the
                    user must now set the maximum number of links they
                    wish to see in a chain.</p>

                <head>Link-based analysis methods</head>
                <p>Scientometrics, the study of scientific research literature
                    using citation data, has been used to study the development
                    of ideas and identify emerging topics for some years(
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">White and McCain, 1989;</ref>
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">van Raan, 1997</ref>). The process generally involves
                    the selection of a body of citation data in a field
                    of interest, followed by computation to identify structures
                    of interest, which are then analysed by an expert to
                    interpret what the structures mean in terms of the
                    development of the field.
                </p>
                <p>Scientometrics overlaps with the study of social networks,
                    which models nets of relationships between people (
                    <ref type="bibr">Pool and Kochen, 1978/79</ref>), via co- authorship
                    studies. In this case, the relationship link is made
                    if two authors have published together and may be weighted
                    according to the number of co- authored publications.
                </p>
                <p>The extension of scientometric practices to analyse the
                    World Wide Web, sometimes called Webometrics, is being
                    actively explored, although not without caveats concerning
                    the signification of hyperlinks
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cronin, 2001</ref>). For scholarly hyperlinks, studies
                    have shown that researchers motives for hyperlinking
                    are closely related to their existing citation behaviour
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kim, 2000</ref>). Therefore it may be reasonable to
                    assume that scholarly hyperlinks are suitable for scientometric
                    study. This view is reinforced by the successful development
                    of Web ranking algorithms that exploit information
                    about the links between Web pages, e.g.,
                    <ref type="bibr">PageRank (Page et al., 1998</ref>) and HITS
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kleinberg, 1999</ref>). Using link information as
                    part of the ranking strategy is considered advantageous
                    because links from domains other than a page's home
                    domain represent some kind of human endorsement of
                    the content. the intersection between scientometrics,
                    co-authorship studies and Web link analysis methods.

                <p>The field was characterized by the common theme of link

                <head n="5.1.">Sketching and refining interpretation with ClaiMapper</head>
                <p>In the first phase of the evaluation we used ClaiMapper
                    and ClaiMaker to build a claim network. The first author
                    undertook the review and initial modelling of the literature
                    in ClaiMapper. By the end of this process some 290+
                    nodes, 340+ links and 64 document nodes had been created.
                    Ideally, we would have like to have had the Claim Network
                    built by a neutral third party. However, since the
                    person who built the review had to be familiar with
                    the tools and willing to commit several weeks of working
                    time, we were constrained to select one of ourselves.</p>
                <p>It was observed that the overall sensemaking process with
                    ClaiMapper fell into three cycles, which over- lapped
                    and followed in sequence, but with backtracking (see
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14)</ref>. The initial cycle is the Gather-Read-Cate-
                    gorize cycle, in which a collection of potentially
                    useful material was obtained, scanned and roughly sorted
                    into topics. The middle cycle is the Read-Model-Categorize
                    cycle. Here the papers were studied in more detail,
                    the arguments were mapped and refinements were made
                    to the categories used. The final cycle was the Model-Reflect-
                    Write cycle, in which the claim networks were used
                    to draft summaries on each of the topics. Backtracking
                    occurred, e.g., when writing and reflecting opened
                    up new questions which required more documents to be
                    gathered.
                </p>
                <p>ClaiMapper provided a space in which to sketch rough ideas,
                    then refine them. It was found that, in this case study,
                    the degree of order in the models seemed to increase
                    over time. For example, in
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 15a</ref> the first screen shot is taken from
                    a backup of the ClaiMapper database taken at a relatively
                    early stage, roughly at the end of the first Gather-Read-Categorize
                    cycle, whereas the second screen- shot
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 15b</ref>) was taken after several Read-Categorize--
                    Model cycles, while writing was in progress.
                </p>
                <p>In
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 15a</ref>, the Home Window: is being used as a
                    scribble pad. Concepts of interest are dotted about
                    and linked to each other and to documents, some represent
                    research articles while others are being used as containers
                    to organize material, rather like a folder in a hierarchical
                    file system. One of these containers has been opened;
                    and contains one document and a series of unconnected
                    concepts. At this point, the structure has some of
                    the aspects of an argument model, related ideas have
                    been joined up at the upper level, but it is largely
                    mnemonic: a sketch of ideas that arose from the initial
                    scan and deserve further investigation.
                </p>
                <p>By the time the screenshot in
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 15b</ref> was taken, the structure of the models
                    had become more organized. The Home Window now contains
                    just eight documents, each of which is acting as a
                    container for documents on a particular topic. The
                    containers have been organized into a shallow hierarchy
                    with ''bibliometrics'' at the top. One of these container
                    documents has been opened. It contains an unconnected
                    list of documents each of which represents an actual
                    article. The right hand small pane shows the argument
                    model for one of these articles. This is expressed
                    using the constraints of the ontology described above
                    and is a machine-interpretable structure that could
                    be uploaded to ClaiMaker as a representation of this
                    document.
                </p>
                <p>We can see in this process that ClaiMapper was able to
                    support the refinement aspect of sensemaking. It appears
                    that as the modeller learnt more about the topic and
                    became more committed to her interpretation of the
                    data, a crystallisation process occurred in which the
                    models became more organized and clear categories emerged.
                    It is a classic example of the move from rough sketches
                    to coherent argument, a phenomenon reported both in
                    empirical studies of designers using argumentation-based
                    design rationale and empirical studies of the use of
                    computer-supported writing tools, reviewed in
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Buckingham Shum and Hammond, 1994)</ref>.
                </p>
                <p>The use of documents as containers in which to subdivide
                    papers by category in this case study may have arisen
                    from the multi-disciplinary nature of the task. This
                    is an interesting example of affordances of the system
                    emerging that were not designed in as functions. One
                    reason that documents could stand in as containers
                    is that ClaiMapper permits transclusion, 6 so papers
                    which bridged categories could be copied into in more
                    than one container and edits made in either place would
                    appear automatically in the other.</p>

                    the first draft of the review. This sectioning was
                    changed later because it did not give sufficient emphasis
                    to the cross disciplinary threads that made the review
                    interesting. However it provided the structure for
                    an initial ''divide and conquer'' step in the writing
                    process, in which topic summaries could be produced
                    simply by looking at the documents in a particular
                    ''folder''. Clearly we cannot draw general conclusions
                    from observations of one individual's use of a tool,
                    but it concurs with the experience of other team members
                    and more broadly with the way in which we know learners
                    gradually elaborate their understanding of a domain
                    through concept splitting, merging and clustering.
                    Clai- Mapper integrated into the natural review process
                    smoothly, adding value in the early stages by providing
                    a scribble pad on which initial observations could
                    be sketched and in the later stages it provided concept
                    manipulation tools for ordering observations and provid-
                    ing notes on them in a way that supported writing and

                <p>The second phase of the evaluation comprised a comparative
                    analysis of the two artefacts produced in phase one,
                    namely the Claim network and the traditional written
                    review. We wanted to determine whether the Claim network,
                    in combination with ClaiMaker and ClaimFin- der, could
                    be used to communicate similar information to that

                    questionnaire was used as the instrument of the study.
                    In particular, we wanted to look at the overall quality
                    of the students' answers, how they handled individual
                    questions and which features of the search tools the
                    claim network group used to find answers.</p>
                <p>There are some confounding factors in the design of this
                    experiment. As we have already commented, ideally the
                    artefacts should have been built by a neutral third
                    party. However this was infeasible. Also the quality
                    of both the claim network and the review were likely
                    to influence the quality of the answers that the students
                    gave. However, the question we were seeking to answer
                    was not very complex. It was simply whether claim networks
                    could communicate information to people other than
                    the creator. The review group give a point of comparison
                    but differences between the media, the history of their
                    preparation (the review was written after and based
                    on the claim network and the questionnaire was written
                    last) and the fact that it was impossible to make the
                    content of the two artefacts identical force us to
                    be cautious about the significance of any differences
                    in the performance of the two groups.</p>
                <p>The participants in the study were six research students
                    studying in KMi. None of them had prior, in-depth knowledge
                    of the topics in the literature selected for the study.
                    Half the group was engaged in research related to discourse
                    mapping and literature analysis. These three were all
                    familiar with the ScholOnto discourse ontology and
                    the ideas underlying claim networks but were not particularly
                    familiar with the tools. These students were assigned
                    to the Claim Network group. The remaining three students
                    were assigned to the Written Review group and worked
                    with a document of about 2300 words in length. It was
                    not considered detrimental to the study to use the
                    students with knowledge of the principles of claim
                    networks to use the tools, since we wished to investigate
                    a scenario in which the basic ideas and instrumental
                    operations were known (just as members of the Written
                    Review group were familiar with reading, pens and paper).
                    Even after deliberately selecting students with some
                    knowledge of claim networks the bias of experience
                    of the medium used still favours the Written Review
                    group.</p>
                <p>A questionnaire was written which could, in principle,
                    be answered using the information provided by either
                    artefact (see
                    <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>). A testing station was set up with the
                    Camtasia 7 screen capture tool to record the participants'
                    interactions with the tools and their verbal comments.
                    While the verbal comments were not used heavily in
                    the analysis reported here, the comments of the claim
                    network group were a valuable source of qualitiative
                    data to understand why they were pursuing particular
                    strategies and to identify design flaws and bugs in
                    the interface. Participants were accompanied by an
                    observer who could assist with any general queries
                    they had about the exercise and who also provided someone
                    to ''think aloud'' to. The questionnaire was presented
                    on screen to facilitate timing how long it took to
                    answer each question. Camtasia recorded participants
                    as they added or edited their answers in this online
                    version and the time taken on each question was estimated
                    from verbal comments and time spent inputting answers.
                    The Claim Network group was given a Microsoft Internet
                    Explorer Web browser with links set up to both ClaiMaker
                    and ClaimFinder. The Written Review group had an open
                    Microsoft Word document containing the review, plus
                    a hard copy version since many people prefer to read
                    on paper.

                <head n="5.2.1.">The questionnaire and correctness scoring system</head>
                <p>Subjects were required to answer the questions listed in
                    <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>. The aim of the questionnaire design
                    was to cover a spread of the topics in the domain and
                    to give questions that ranged in complexity from extracting
                    facts to demonstrating some understanding of the topics.
                    Taking some examples: question 2 concerns the topic
                    of link ranking only and simply requires the participant
                    to identify some names of algorithms, question 6 concerns
                    both scientometrics and the Web and expects the participant
                    to be able to identify issues that are problems and
                    question 10 concerns all the topics and requires the
                    user to form an overview of them. The openness and
                    complexity of the questions tends to increase towards
                    the end of the questionnaire to give students the opportunity
                    to acquire some knowledge of the domain.
                </p>
                <p>To assess the correctness of the results, we constructed
                    a ''gold standard'' set of answers by merging the answers
                    of the three individuals who tested the questionnaire
                    prior to the study. These were the first author, who
                    had access to the review and the claim network, the
                    second author, who only used the claim network and
                    an experienced research student who was not part of
                    the research team, who only used the review. A marking
                    scheme was devised and the third author, who was not
                    involved in any other part of the evaluation, marked
                    the answer scripts.</p>
                <p>The scoring system was weighted equally across the questions;
                    it allotted a maximum of two marks per answer, giving
                    a maximum score of 22. For factual questions, a list
                    was supplied of all the items listed by the gold standard
                    group in answers and a suggested mark was allotted
                    for each item up to a maximum of 2. Question 2, for
                    example, had half a mark per algorithm up to a maximum
                    of 2 marks. The exception was question 7, which asks
                    for precisely three properties In this case a bonus
                    half-mark was awarded if the participant gave exactly
                    three. For the more open questions the marker had to
                    use some discretion and judge how well argued the answer
                    was and whether it included reference to any of the
                    issues raised by the testers.</p>
                <p>We also recorded the times participants took to answer
                    individual questions to determine their relative difficulty.
                    The decision of a participant to move from one question
                    to another was a cognitive process which could not
                    always be timed with precision. The timings were therefore
                    measured in minutes and rounded up. Minutes gave sufficient
                    accuracy to get a feel for the relative difficulty
                    of questions, which was our main aim.</p>

                <p>Our analysis of the data in the Camtasia movies and the
                    students' answers to questions covered several aspects.
                    Correctness and actual time taken to answer questions
                    gave us an indication of the comparable difficulty
                    of the two tasks (review or claim network). The per
                    question analysis of relative time taken and answers
                    given helped us understand whether there were affordances
                    of the two artefacts which were advantageous in particular
                    situations.</p>
                <p>We gave special attention to the questions which required
                    the participants to interpret the material they were
                    given. An analysis of how the participants in the Claim
                    Network group used the available interfaces informed
                    us about which services were found to be most helpful.</p>
                <p>5.2.2.1. Task difficulty.
                    <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 5</ref> clearly shows that the Written Review
                    group was able to answer the questions faster than
                    the Claim Network group. This was to be expected for
                    several reasons. First the review has ''added value''
                    over the claim network: it was written by the researcher
                    based on her understanding of the topics built up by
                    constructing the claim network. Secondly, members of
                    the Written Review group were far more familiar with
                    the medium they were working with (essentially a reading
                    comprehension test) than members of the Claim Network
                    group. It was observed that all the members of the
                    Written Review group used the printed version as their
                    main resource and the version on the computer as an
                    occasional look up. It would be unreasonable to expect
                    similar ease of use with unfamiliar tools in comparison
                    to a skill which the Written Review group had been
                    practising for many years. Furthermore, the review
                    was quite short, only about 2300 words. This was necessary
                    to allow the Written Review group to read it and complete
                    the questionnaire under experimental conditions. However,
                    it is possible that if the review had been longer (e.g.
                    23,000 rather than 2300 words) the search and exploration
                    services available to the Claim Network group would
                    have given them an advantage.
                </p>
                <p>The variability in the times taken by the Claim Network
                    group was far greater than for the Written Review group.
                    This seemed to be largely due to their personal style
                    of question answering, in particular, the slowest participant
                    had a very analytical approach to both the questions
                    and the data in the claims.</p>
                <p>We also observed that the Claim Network group generally
                    gave far more ''thinking aloud'' contributions, which
                    was an additional distractor and tended to increase
                    actual time to answer questions. The reluctance of
                    the Written Review participants to think aloud may
                    stem from the strong habit of reading silently. Breaking
                    that silence to comment on questions is a barrier.
                    Finally, the difference in correctness between the
                    two groups' answers was small; the review group scored
                    1.4 more on average, a difference of about 6%. This
                    difference is not particularly large, suggesting that
                    the claim network can be understood by people other
                    than the creator.</p>

                <p>Per-question analysis.
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 16</ref> shows in the bar chart the proportion
                    of question answering time spent for each question
                    and in the table the score of each participant on each
                    question. For the review participants consideration
                    was given to the fairest way to deal with reading time.
                    Alternative approaches we considered were: to ignore
                    it and start timing at the first point at which the
                    participant started to address a question, to divide
                    reading time equally between the questions (which seemed
                    intuitively wrong), or to portion out the reading time
                    across the questions in proportion to the amount of
                    time spent on questions (which results in no change
                    compared to ignoring reading time). The decision was
                    complicated by the fact that only one of the group
                    began the exercise by reading the review all the way
                    through while other two started to answer some questions
                    before they had finished reading the whole document.
                    Consequently, we decided to opt for the first and simplest
                    method which has the additional advantage of being
                    most directly comparable with the times for the Claim
                    Network group who did not have a reading period. These
                    were calculated to remove the effect of personal style;
                    for example, within the Claim Network group actual
                    times were very variable. Relative time per question
                    provides an indicator as to whether members of one
                    group found certain questions relatively harder to
                    answer than the other group.
                </p>
                <p>For most of the questions there is no indication from performance
                    times that one group of participants found any question
                    noticeably harder than the other group. For question
                    4 the Written Review group found it easier to answer
                    the question than the Claim Network group, whereas
                    for questions 7 and 9 the latter completed the task
                    in a relatively shorter time. In terms of correctness,
                    only question 5 shows a difference between the groups
                    with the review group all getting perfect scores and
                    the Network group all scoring 1 or below. We will look
                    at these three questions in detail.</p>
                <p>The Claim Network group found question 4 (''What is scientometrics?'')
                    relatively harder to answer than the Written Review
                    group. The latter had little trouble finding a definition
                    in the first sentence of the section of the review
                    headed ''scientometrics'' and all copied this into
                    the answer sheet as ''Scientometrics is the study of
                    scientific research literature using citation data''.
                    The Claim Network group took a much more exploratory
                    approach. A similar definition had been embedded in
                    the notes field of the node labelled ''scientometrics''.
                    However, none of the Claim Network group thought to
                    look for it. They knew that notes existed but most
                    of the nodes did not have them and there was no visual
                    flag to indicate that this node did (this is a user
                    interface design flaw highlighted by the study). Instead
                    they all looked at the nodes immediately adjacent to
                    ''scientometrics'' and constructed their answers from
                    those. These produced some acceptable definitions,
                    e.g.</p>

                <p>From what I understand, scientometrics is a kind of meta-science,
                    or a discipline, or a research area, that measures
                    and represents 'discourse' phenomena within scientific
                    research: for instance, providing a picture of how
                    discourse develops in a field, through mapping literature
                    (relations between researchers' work, perspec- tives,
                    concepts, discourse acts like publications, etc.).
                    To use ClaiMaker phrasing, it aims at providing evolu-
                    tionary models of science, technology and scholarship.</p>
                <p>This definition certainly reflects the background of the
                    person who wrote it (a student of semiotics and discourse)
                    but she has clearly formed a personal view of what
                    scientometrics is. To summarize, while the process
                    was more time consuming, it could be argued that the
                    members of the Claim Network group were forced to engage
                    more with the material and understand it, not having
                    the option to simply paste the opening sentence conveniently
                    found at the start of the Written Review.</p>
                <p>By contrast it was the Written Review group who had trouble
                    with question 7 (''Name three properties you would
                    expect to see in social networks?''). The Claim Network
                    group were helped by the text of three nodes. They
                    all searched for nodes that contained the words ''social
                    networks'' and got these: ''Social networks are assortative'',
                    ''Social networks have a high degree of clustering''
                    and ''Social networks are divided into groups and communities'',
                    as shown in
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 17</ref>.
                </p>
                <p>Two out of three of the Claim Network group turned these
                    directly into three properties with which to answer
                    the question. The third decided that clusters were
                    similar to groups and searched in the neighbourhood
                    of these claims to extract the property: ''in social
                    networks connections don't develop randomly''.</p>
                <p>The Written Review group had greater difficulty in picking
                    similar properties from the text. Each had to spend
                    several minutes reading through the section of the
                    text headed ''Social networks'' and one of them reported
                    difficulties with the question. At the end each Written
                    Review participant produced a rather different list
                    of properties and only one of them gave a set that
                    was similar to those reported by the Claim Network
                    group. The Written Review group had to interpret several
                    paragraphs of text in order to pick out properties
                    whereas the Claim Network group had an easy way to
                    answer the question. These differences come from the
                    way pieces of information were presented in the two
                    artefacts.</p>
                <p>It is of course possible to design either artefact to highlight
                    particular information, an issue to which we return
                    in the discussion. However, the relative ease with
                    which the Claim Network group tackled Question 9 (''Give
                    the titles of two papers which report on combining
                    information from Web pages with link analysis algo-
                    rithms'') stems from the generic affordances of the
                    online system. Each Concept is related to a paper whose
                    bibliographic details are stored within the system.
                    An icon is presented with each concept that allows
                    the user to open up a ''details'' box with the reference
                    in it. Having identified relevant concepts the participants
                    simply had to check the details boxes and extract two
                    different titles. The review participants had to deal
                    with the familiar difficulties of matching a reference
                    marker to the reference itself in a text document,
                    although they mitigated this problem by doing text
                    searches on authors' names in their online versions.</p>

                <p>Finally, we will look at question 5 (''What does van Raan
                    consider to be the sub-tasks of scientometrics?''),
                    the only question for which there was a noticeable
                    difference in scores between the two groups. In this
                    case this difference can be explained by features in
                    both artefacts. The written review had a bullet pointed
                    list summarising van Raan's analysis. ClaimFinder,
                    on the other hand, only had facilities for searching
                    on content words not on authors' names. This had not
                    posed a problem for the testers because they were both
                    fluent users of ClaiMaker and simply switched over
                    to the ''expert'' interface to answer this question.
                    This difference reveals a design flaw in the novice
                    interface that can be corrected by a simple change
                    in how the ClaimFinder index is built.</p>
                <p>5.2.2.3. Tackling interpretive questions. The first nine
                    questions were fact-finding tasks. The last two questions
                    required the participants to consider the material
                    they had been presented with as a whole. Question 10
                    (''What unifying notion is common to scientometrics,
                    social networks studies and link ranking algorithms?'')
                    required a synthesis of ideas encountered in answering
                    the previous nine questions. The two groups showed
                    quite different approaches to tackling this question.
                    Two of the Claim Network group assumed there was some
                    mechanism for tracing a path between concepts in the
                    tool. In fact this facility did not exist and they
                    ended up doing extensive searches of the neighbourhood
                    of each concept trying to ''manually'' identify a Concept
                    that was linked to all of them. One participant gave
                    up when he could not find such a concept. The other
                    two found the Concept ''Cognitive and socio-organisational
                    structures in science and technology'' which is joined
                    directly to both the ''scientometrics'' and ''social
                    networks'' Concepts
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 18)</ref>. This helped each of them to start
                    formulating an answer.
                </p>
                <p>The Written Review participants knew there was no ''magic
                    button'' they could press and that they would have
                    to generate an answer from their own interpretation
                    of the review. Their answers all drew on the idea of
                    clustering and communities, ideas which had been mentioned
                    in several sections of the review. Thus, on a high
                    level, both groups produced answers about the identification
                    of patterns, but in slightly different ways.</p>
                <p>Question 11 is perhaps the most fundamental of the questions
                    we asked and the most open-ended. Would the participants
                    be able to identify open research questions using the
                    information in the artefacts? As research students
                    they had all been engaged in identifying research questions
                    in their own domains but none of them specialized in
                    the specific topics addressed in this study. Nor would
                    one normally expect students to start formulating research
                    questions after only being exposed to a domain for
                    an hour or so. Therefore we did not expect particularly
                    well- developed replies. We also expected that although

                <p>answers would be found partly in the material we presented,
                    they might also relate to the students' own characters,
                    interests and experience, since researchers' worldviews
                    affect which questions they choose to ask and even
                    find meaningful
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Reich, 1994)</ref>.
                </p>
                <p>As a consequence of these factors we did not expect the
                    participants to give similar answers to Question 11.
                    Our aim was first and foremost to see if they could
                    give any answers and secondarily to make a judgment
                    of how useful their answers were. The answers the students
                    gave are presented in
                    <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>.
                </p>
                <p>All but one of the participants (D) produced a fairly complex
                    answer. Participant D's answer, ''Social networks probably
                    because it would inform the others'', is certainly
                    not a foolish one. The student has realized that the
                    papers researchers choose to cite and the pages they
                    choose to make Web links to are partly social behaviours
                    and that this could be an interesting thing to look
                    at.</p>
                <p>Some of the other answers demonstrate misconceptions on
                    the part of the participants. For example, in A's question,
                    the statement ''I could work on clustering decays''
                    comes from a search to look for problems that had been
                    identified in the network as a stimulus for forming
                    a research question. This brought up, among others
                    the Concept ''clustering coefficient decays with time'',
                    the word ''decays'' has negative connotations generally,
                    but in this case it refers only to the decrease in
                    a numerical measure of clustering observed in social
                    networks as they grow. While it would be possible to
                    study its causes, it is unlikely that the decay could
                    be influenced significantly. Errors such as this and
                    our observation of the candidates' behaviour in answering
                    questions leads us to believe that if claim networks
                    are to work well great clarity of language will be
                    required. For the model we tested, the network contained
                    very little text compared to the written review (although
                    it is possible within the ScholOnto framework to attach
                    detailed descriptions to nodes). This means that the
                    understanding of the participants rested heavily on
                    a few words. If there was an ambiguity, or if they
                    were unfamiliar with the technical vocabulary in a
                    field they could easily form a false opinion. This
                    was less common for the Review group. Ambiguity itself
                    is an issue relating to the content of the network
                    model rather than any affordances of the tools, but
                    there are interesting future challenges in building
                    tools which support users in expressing themselves
                    as clearly as possible.</p>
                <p>Participant C makes assumptions about social networks research
                    that are not true, probably reflecting her back- ground
                    in hypertext which forms a view of what properties
                    a link has.</p>
                <p>The influence of the students' backgrounds was a strong
                    factor in the kinds of questions they chose. For example
                    participant E is interested in adaptive algorithms,
                    while F is studying natural language processing.</p>
                <p>Four of the participants (A, C, D and F) provide answers
                    which go beyond the information in the artefacts. They
                    have clearly realized that to formulate a research
                    question they will have to go beyond what has already
                    been

                <p>Research question proposed in response to question 11 A
                    (Claim Network) I'd have a look at the problems or
                    shortcomings identified in one of these areas. For
                    instance: I could work on clustering decays and try
                    to reduce them. They are an important part of social
                    networks and their reduction could increase the deployment
                    of social network. Why? Because someone has said that
                    they were an issue for social network. So why not tackle
                    it? B (Claim Network) If my criteria was based on the
                    amount of information available, I would have to choose
                    the social networks aspect. This seemed to have been
                    the best-covered topic in the database. In terms of
                    personal interest and background knowledge I would
                    have to choose the scientometrics aspect. The aspect
                    I would least likely undertake would be the link ranking
                    algorithms since this has a lot of terms that are not
                    very familiar and not well defined in the database.</p>

                <head>C (Claim Network)</head>
                <p>If I wanted to study social networks on the web, I would
                    try to look into the way people use links and express
                    patterns of link use (paths). This would interest me
                    because I think it would help me to identify people's
                    thinking, and the way they interpret what they find,
                    through the series of connections that they follow.</p>

                <p>Social networks probably because it would inform the others.
                    E (Written Review) I would be interested in research
                    on social networks that evolve over time and that can
                    be used for providing estimations of the importance
                    of documents. Social networks and small-networks in
                    particular appear to have attracted the interest of
                    many researchers from various disciplines.</p>

                <head>F (Written Review)</head>
                <p>All of these methods rely on exploiting explicit links
                    between papers. What appears to be missing is the reason
                    for the reference. Once the network has been built
                    and displayed graphically, it may be possible to use
                    deeper NLP techniques to identify types of reference.
                    A reference may be given for many reasons such as identifying
                    the originator of some notion, theory or claim. A reference
                    may be given because the particular work fills a gap
                    revealed by another or it contradicts the other claim.
                    It may be possible to deduce the nature of the citation
                    on the fly when a reader is interested. Alternatively,
                    this could be done for each citation which would be
                    computationally expensive, but demonstrate different
                    structures such as the genealogy of ideas or controversies,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>done. Since they are split equally between the two groups
                    it can be argued that the claim network was at least
                    as good at communicating the information needed to
                    start formulating research questions as the review.
                    However the small number of participants restricts
                    the generality of conclusions which can be drawn without
                    further investigation.</p>

                    divided into those using three different ClaimFinder
                    search interfaces (Find, Discovery and Advanced), those
                    using the ClaiMaker system and those using three of
                    the icon links illustrated in
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref>. Search action data is presented in
                    <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 7</ref> and
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 19</ref>. In addition to the actions of the three
                    participants, we have included in
                    <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 7</ref> a summary of the search actions of an
                    expert user (the second author) who tested the questionnaire
                    prior to the main experiment. The most heavily used
                    features were the Find search in ClaimFinder (18%),
                    a simple search for keywords in concepts and the Anchor
                    icon (42%), which selects a concept to be the focus
                    of a Neighbourhood search, as described in Section
                    4.2.3. This pattern of use reflects the dominant searching
                    strategy, which was to perform a keyword-based search
                    to locate the topic required and then to explore the
                    local region of the network.
                </p>
                <p>All three participants used some of the Discovery and Advanced
                    search features in ClaimFinder. This was some- times
                    because the dominant Find/Anchor pattern had failed,
                    but another motivation seemed to be simple exploration;
                    as they grew more used to the results of the simple
                    Find they explored new techniques.</p>
                <p>Only one participant (A) used any of the ClaiMaker features
                    even though all the participants were shown that shortcuts
                    to both were given on the toolbar. Participant A was
                    a research student who had been involved in developing
                    input tools for ScholOnto models and had previous experience
                    of using ClaiMaker. He used it briefly at the beginning
                    of his session before concentrating on the more attractive
                    ClaimFinder interface.</p>
                <p>Participants B and C showed a bias towards using the Concept
                    and Document icons, respectively. Both used them mainly
                    for checking bibliographic data, which is duplicated
                    in the two places. This may merely reflect habits established
                    by early success with one method or the other. It perhaps
                    indicates that the two icons could be merged to reduce
                    clutter in the display.</p>
                <p>When we compare the actions taken by the three students
                    with those of the expert user
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 20)</ref> we saw a similar foraging behaviour
                    with use of an initial service followed by repeated
                    use of the anchor icon for exploration. As would be
                    expected, the expert has a much wider repertoire of
                    actions and the initial service was not usually the
                    Find service in ClaimFinder. He used the ''unfriendly''
                    ClaiMaker a lot more, 22% of actions compared to 2%
                    for the students. This may be partly because the expert
                    had more than 2 years experience of using ClaiMaker
                    so tended to turn to it before the less familiar (to
                    him) ClaimFinder interface. However there is evidence
                    that he was exploiting services and controlling parameters
                    via the ClaimMaker interface that were not available
                    through ClaimFinder.
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 21</ref> gives a breakdown of the ClaiMaker actions
                    of the expert user and the actions included in the

                <p>Some of the expert's ClaiMaker actions mirror the ClaimFinder
                    usage of the Claim Network group. He used Neighbourhood
                    six times, which gave him the same output as the Find
                    service in ClaimFinder, but more control over the parameters
                    he could search for, e.g., he could search for words
                    in the title of an article as well as keywords in Concepts.
                    His searches for concepts by keyword and IP Owner mirrored
                    the kind of services that can be found through the
                    ClaimFinder Advanced menu.</p>
                <p>His use of link tracking (see
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> and screen movie clip 8 ), however, shows
                    him using a service which was not put into ClaimFinder
                    because it was considered too complex for a novice
                    user. It gives the user a lot of options, including
                    keywords in left-or right-hand concepts, specific link
                    types, groups of link types drawn from the taxonomy
                    and the depth of search. Having done a link- tracking
                    search the expert user would then often explore the
                    TouchGraph visualization of the results, by clicking
                    the TouchGraph icon, a form of presentation which the
                    students did not use heavily.

                <p>5.2.2.5. Summary of comparative evaluation study. To summarize,
                    while there was a clear advantage in terms of actual
                    time taken for the Written Review group, it could be
                    argued that the review had added value over the Claim
                    Network. Furthermore the Written Review group had a
                    major advantage in terms of experience with the artefacts.
                    Both groups gave appropriate answers to the questions
                    suggesting that the claim network was interpretable
                    by users other than its creator. In terms of tool use,
                    the three Claim Network participants concentrated mainly
                    on using the simpler functions. However the ClaimFinder
                    tool seemed to invite them to use more complex functions
                    as their confidence increased. The expert user's usage
                    patterns suggest that, with increased 'literacy' with
                    these new tools, users develop more complex search
                    strategies.</p>

                <head n="6.">Conclusions</head>
                <p>New technologies, such as digital libraries, have in- creased
                    the availability of documents dramatically. For researchers
                    this has generated a need for better tools to make
                    sense of the many papers they can now access. In the
                    Scholarly Ontologies project, we proposed a computational
                    approach to support such scholarly sensemaking. Our
                    argument is that classical truth maintenance models
                    would not be fit for this purpose. Instead the scheme
                    adopted must enable evidence to be presented simultaneously
                    in favour of claims and complemented by counter-claims.
                    Thus we propose an ontology of rhetorical relations
                    for principled agreement and disagreement which can
                    support multiple interpretations. This uses a claim
                    network representation to model a document's key contributions
                    and relationships to the literature. The network approach
                    has focussed our knowledge modelling effort on capturing
                    relationships between objects, rather than simply indexing
                    instances of objects. To this end the Scholarly Ontologies
                    project has investigated a new kind of digital library
                    server in which it would be possible to go beyond searching
                    metadata and to ask questions more pertinent to research.</p>
                <p>In this paper, we have presented three related prototype
                    systems which have been developed during the project
                    to support users in the creation and exploration of
                    claim</p>

                <head>Breakdown of ClaiMaker and Other Actions</head>
                <p>Set document icon, 1 networks, namely ClaiMaker, ClaiMapper
                    and ClaimFin- der. We also presented a two-phase evaluation
                    study in which a review was made of a multi-disciplinary
                    domain during which a claim network was built. Two
                    groups of students, one group using a written literature
                    review based on this modelling and the other using
                    the claim network itself, answered questions about
                    the domain. This case study allowed us to investigate
                    the utility of the tools and the approach. The results
                    of the case study indicate that the claim network approach
                    presented here can support services which address questions
                    like ''where did this idea come from?'' and ''what
                    evidence supports this idea?'' Furthermore, it was
                    observed that as the review progressed the degree of
                    order in the models produced in the ClaiMapper interface
                    increased, suggesting that it was able to support and
                    reflect back to the analyst, the process of conceptual
                    refinement, an important part of sensemaking activity.</p>
                <p>The case study has demonstrated that claim networks helped
                    the participants to form their own opinions. For instance,
                    the Claim Network participants were more inclined than
                    the Written Review group to construct personal answers
                    rather than to extract answers from the artefact as
                    if they were ''truth''. Possibly this is because the
                    relative sparseness of the network representation forces
                    the user to mentally fill in some of the gaps in the
                    information they are presented with, or it may simply
                    be that dealing with an unfamiliar representation forces
                    the user to think harder, with a richer articulation
                    of ideas as a positive side- effect. While it is beyond
                    the scope of this study to speculate further on the
                    cognitive processes of the participants, it is worth
                    noting that working with the claim networks brought
                    out some different thinking skills in line with positive
                    results reported for the use of argument visualization
                    in teaching reasoning skills
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carr, 2003)</ref> and for mind mapping in education
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Novak and Gowin, 1984)</ref>.
                </p>
                <p>In addition, we observed a common search strategy in which
                    the students using the claim network performed a simple
                    search to locate a node with the right keywords in
                    it and then explored the region of claims around it,
                    often using the anchor icon to initiate neighbourhood
                    searches. This behaviour is typical of the information
                    foraging behaviour described by
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pirolli and Card (1999)</ref>. The users are locating
                    what is called an ''information patch'' and then grazing
                    on the information in the patch until either they can
                    answer the question to their satisfaction or they have
                    exhausted the information there and need to move to
                    a new patch. Although the data from this case study
                    is limited to only three users, all of them demonstrated
                    foraging behaviour, which is common in information
                    systems generally. It seems reasonable to conclude
                    that it was an important way for them to interact with
                    these models. The next round of tool development should
                    therefore focus on developing the functionality of
                    browsing tools and the clarity of their outputs to
                    help users forage as effectively as possible. ACT-IF,
                    the formal process model presented by Pirolli and Card
                    in their 1999 paper to describe information foraging,
                    presents a candidate cogni- tive modelling approach
                    to evaluate new tools or interfaces aimed at supporting
                    browsing.
                </p>
                <p>The sparseness of the representation had disadvantages;
                    when the representation was ambiguous it could cause
                    misunderstanding. It seems that if claim networks are
                    to be used collaboratively the users will have to learn
                    to express themselves precisely, which is to say in
                    the terms that their community will understand. Ambiguities
                    may also emerge as triggers for debate when communities
                    start working together on building networks.</p>
                <p>Finally, while it was demonstrated that the claim networks
                    can convey information about a subject domain, we do
                    not claim it is a substitute for text. Text allows
                    the author more flexibility in constructing the narrative
                    and more influence on the reader because the author
                    has control of the order in which information is presented.
                    Our observations suggest that our participants could
                    handle information in written format faster than using
                    the claim network. That said, the prose review and
                    claim network were both relatively small and the Claim
                    Network group had much less experience of the medium
                    than the Written Review group. It is possible that
                    if the written review had been longer and the users
                    of the claim network had more experience, it would
                    have been possible to better show the benefits of the
                    search services.</p>
                <p>In summary, the ScholOnto research project has been envisioning
                    how scholarly knowledge may be published and contested
                    in the future. A variety of prototype tools have been
                    developed in our pursuit of an environment which would
                    enable analysts to express their perspective of the
                    ideas in a literature, which could then be published
                    and interrogated as a personal, or shared, model. The
                    evalua- tion reported has taken the first step by demonstrating
                    that given the right tool, literature analysis can
                    be assisted by the construction of claim networks and
                    that, within the limits of the study reported, these
                    networks could effectively convey information to users
                    other than their creator. Although the tools we produced
                    support group- working at a technical level,
                    <ref type="bibr">we</ref> have not yet studied their synchronous or
                    asynchronous use in collaborative envir- onments. We
                    conclude that the Scholarly Ontologies approach to
                    sensemaking is worthy of further investiga- tion, to
                    improve and further evaluate the tools.
