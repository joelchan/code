  <zone label="MET_ABSTRACT">Abstract
This paper describes the work undertaken in the Scholarly Ontologies Project. The aim of the project has been to develop a
computational approach to support scholarly sensemaking, through interpretation and argumentation, enabling researchers to make
claims: to describe and debate their view of a document's key contributions and relationships to the literature. The project has
investigated the technicalities and practicalities of capturing conceptual relations, within and between conventional documents in terms
of abstract ontological structures. In this way, we have developed a new kind of index to distributed digital library systems. This paper
reports a case study undertaken to test the sensemaking tools developed by the Scholarly Ontologies project. The tools used were
ClaiMapper, which allows the user to sketch argument maps of individual papers and their connections, ClaiMaker, a server on which
such models can be stored and saved, which provides interpretative services to assist the querying of argument maps across multiple
papers and ClaimFinder, a novice interface to the search services in ClaiMaker.

Researchers are interested in questions such as: How does
the expert community perceive this theory, model, language,

What kind of evidence supports it and challenges it? Are
there different schools of thought on this issue? Answers to
these kinds of questions arise out of the private sensemaking

individuals and groups construct meaning when confronted
by complex, sometimes contradictory information.
We literally 'make sense' by giving form to our evolving
understanding of the meaning of data and ideas, as we seek
to relate them to our existing conceptual structures,
through writing, talking, sketching and other forms of
external representation. In the absence of a single canonical
view of the world, we must construct 'plausible narratives'
to fill in the gaps. Within scholarly discourse, there are
accepted ways of establishing (and contesting) plausibility.
In this kind of sensemaking, past reading assists the
interpretation of related documents which in turn lead the
reader on to explore new texts.
In this paper, we describe the prototype tools which have
been developed to support sensemaking and report on a
case study in which the tools were put to use. In Section 2,
we present the aims of the Scholarly Ontologies Project, for
which the tools were developed and outline its approach
to representing scholarly argument. In Section 3, we present
related work. In Section 4, we describe the tools,</zone>

report on the case study. This study had two parts. In the
first, ClaiMapper was used to construct a model of a
literature as a network of claims. This part was about the
use of the tools to record and support sensemaking. In the
second part of the study, ClaiMaker and ClaimFinder were
used to examine the claim network. This part looked at
whether the models could be usefully interpreted by users
other than the creator. In Section 6 we reflect on the
advantages and limitations of the approach.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">2. The Scholarly Ontologies Project</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">The Scholarly Ontologies Project was an EPSRC
project, funded as part of the programme on Distributed
Information Management, with the aim of developing a
'claims server' to support scholarly interpretation and
argumentation. It investigated the practicality of publishing
explicit, semi-formal conceptual structures in a
collective knowledge base. These structures are grounded
in conventional documents which are accessible, via
hyperlinks, directly from the claims server. In this way,
the claims server has the additional role of a new kind of
index to distributed digital library collections. The system
enables researchers to make claims: to describe and debate
their view of a document's key contributions and relationships
to the literature.
2.1. Representing interpretation and argument
''Ontology'' is the term used in knowledge modelling to
describe an abstract specification of concepts, attributes
and relationships whose meanings are agreed by the
ontology's users (Gruber, 1993). Typically, ontologies are
applied to control interpretation or semantic annotation in
a specific domain, such as travel, enabling interoperability
between, for instance, airline and hotel booking sites.
In contrast, we propose an ontology not only to
represent consensus, but also principled disagreement,
which can support multiple interpretations. These might
be different interpretations of the claims in a single paper
or between a number of papers. The resolution of the
apparent contradiction between the use of ontologies to
control interpretation and our use of an ontology to
represent multiple interpretations comes from the observation
that, while researchers do not necessarily agree on the
issues under debate, the mechanisms of scholarly debate do
remain stable over time. Whether research is in the arts or
sciences, there will always be problems that are of key
interest, people will put forward theories, predictions,
hypotheses, etc., and try to support them with data and
analysis. These contributions may, in their turn, be
challenged or developed further. In order to tackle the
problem of multiple interpretations, our knowledge modelling
effort has focused on capturing these enduring,
discipline-independent relationships between objects,
which we call discourse relations, rather than the types of
objects. This and other requirements for the ontology
required for representing scholarly debate in a claims server
are outlined in Table 1.
The base form of the representation is a directed graph in
which Concepts form the nodes and the links are drawn
from a taxonomy of discourse relations. Concepts are
stored as short pieces of free text succinctly summarising a
contribution, at whatever granularity the researcher wishes.
A claim is a triple of two such objects connected by a link
(Fig. 1). Other objects which may be used as nodes in
claims include sets (collections of concepts) and claims
themselves.
Within the ontology we have a taxonomy of link types to
represent the rhetoric of researchers when they present
their arguments (see Fig. 2). Relations are classified into
groups with similar rhetorical implications: Supports/
Challenges, Problem Related, Taxonomic, Causal, Similarity
and General. Each relation belongs to exactly one of
these groups. Some of these groups, such as Supports/
Challenges and Problem Related enable the user to take
positions. Others, particularly the Causal and Taxonomic
relations, support the building of models of domains for
arguments to refer to. These are not argumentation
relations. However, we discovered that they were necessary
to allow users to provide supporting material to make their
arguments comprehensible. It can be argued that these two
categories of groups should be split at a higher level of the
taxonomy into relations about content and relations about
positions. However we have not followed this route in the
version presented here. The design and evolution of the
ontology is described by Buckingham Shum et al. (2002).
Its theoretical relationship to discourse relations theory,
specifically Cognitive Coherence Relations theory, is
detailed in Mancini (2005).2
Each relation is identified by a natural language label.
This can be changed for communities with different
rhetorical styles helping us tackle requirements 1 and 6 in
Table 1.
Each relation is assigned two properties: a polarity which
indicates whether it has positive or negative implications
(e.g. the label proves has positive polarity whereas refutes
has negative polarity; it implies disproof) and a weight
(high or low) which indicates how forceful it is (e.g. refutes
is more forceful than disagreesWith). The assignment of
polarity allows us to tackle requirement 2 in Table 1. The
assignment of polarity and weighting is illustrated for the
Supports/Challenges class in Table 2.
In addition to Concepts, two other kinds of object can be
used as the nodes in Claims. These are Sets, groups of
concepts brought together by the user because they share a
2Cognitive Coherence Relations theory is derived from research into
coherence relations in text and speech. Approaches in these fields such as
Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp, 1981) focus on
modelling formally sentential relationships and sub-structure, but this is
too fine a granularity to expect from users except trained discourse
analysts. Approaches such as DRT might be used to analyse the content of
concepts in claims.

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">1. Mimic natural language expressions to reduce the cognitive gap: The underlying structure should be based on a noun/verb metaphor with the relations
taking the role of verbs. Making arguments in pseudo-natural language was intended to make the scheme intuitive for contributors.
2. Permit the expression of dissent: A classical truth maintenance model would not be fit for purpose; if ''truth'' is established on an issue, it ceases to be
worth doing research about. The scheme must therefore be closer to that presented by Toulmin (1958), with evidence being presented in favour of claims
and complemented by counter-claims. To support or challenge a claim, the modeller uses relations with either positive or negative polarity. The concept of
polarity is drawn from the work of Knott and Mellish on Cognitive Coherence Relations (CCR) (Knott and Mellish, 1996). To agree with a proposition,
the relation used would have positive polarity. To disagree it would have negative polarity. Giving relations polarity opens up the possibility of providing
services at a higher level of granularity than that of individual link labels. See Mancini and Buckingham Shum (2004) and Uren et al. (2004) for further
discussion on CCR.
3. Signal the ownership of public content: Contributors must take responsibility for the claims they make because we depend on the social control of peer
pressure to motivate high quality claim making. Although a peer-reviewing process could be conceived we have not attempted one in the early prototypes.
Ownership also has a key role in the claims server as digital library server: claims would be ''backed up'' by a link to a published paper. There is an analogy
here with Toulmin's warrants.
4. Accommodate the social dimensions to being explicit: Argument modelling invites researchers to consider making explicit what is normally implicit in the
text of a paper (discussed in Buckingham Shum et al., 2000). Consider a relation refutes. This is a forceful term and therefore should carry greater weight in
calculations than, for example, takes issue with. From the social side, some contributors might prefer to use the less extreme term when linking to concepts
created by eminent figures. Providing these soft options recognises the social dimensions to citation, and aims to remove a possible barrier to adoption.
5. Assign concepts no category outside of use: We require that the typing of object should be optional and that objects may change their type depending on
the context. A key precept of conventional approaches to ontologies is that objects in a scheme are typed under one or more classes. While this is
acceptable for non-controversial attributes such as Software, this cannot be sustained when we are talking about the role that a concept plays in multiple
arguments. The concept that is a Problem under debate in one paper may be an Assumption in another (or even within the same paper). The scheme must
therefore allow the same concept to take on several types in different situations.
6. Assist in making connections across disciplinary boundaries: We are trying to identify a core set of argumentation relations that are useful in many
disciplines. However, the precise terms used for making a case will differ from one research community to another. We tackle this using the idea of dialects.
Drawing again on Cognitive Coherence Relations (see 2.), we define a core set of relational classes, with properties such as type, polarity and weight, but
these may be reified with natural language labels in many ways. For instance, a community in which it would be strange or unacceptable to refute
someone's work could change the label to something they felt more comfortable with (e.g. raises serious questions), but the basic properties of the strongly
negative relation that challenges a concept would remain unchanged. This method would let us configure claim servers for different communities without
altering the underlying reasoning engine.

common theme and Claim triples themselves. This single
level of nesting allowed users to build complex arguments,
while mitigating the implementation difficulties posed by
fully recursive structures. Later in the prototyping cycle an
extension of Sets was implemented which allows an element
of a Set to be another Set or a claim. This allows more
deeply nested structures to be built.
A concept may be assigned a type (e.g. /DataS
/EvidenceS /HypothesisS). However typing of concepts

is optional (although in a pedagogical context it might be
appropriate to enforce concept typing as a way to lead
students to think more carefully about their claims).
Optional typing is unusual in ontologies but is motivated</zone>

objects may play different roles in different contexts, since
researchers may disagree on the node's type: e.g. is this</zone>

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">One person's underlying Theory may be someone else's
Problem. An author may even problematize an idea later
on in a text, which she has up to that point treated as an
unproblematic Theory, Language, etc. Our approach,
therefore, is that if a type is assigned it is stored as part
of the link connecting it to another concept rather than as
an intrinsic part of the concept. This has the effect of
making node-typing context dependent and thus permits
multiple typing of the same concept in different relations.
We also argue that for some relations typing the concepts is
redundant since the role of the nodes is implied by the
relation type. The link types is evidence for, which implies
the left-hand node is a piece of evidence and addresses,
which implies the right-hand side is a problem and the left a
remedy, are examples of this behaviour.
The cost of this approach is that removing any
compulsion on users to type their concepts does reduce
the level of detail of analysis possible. Here we chose to
trade off computational power against cognitive load on
users and produced a ''good enough'' representation. We
envisage that certain communities might want to complement
the discourse ontology with their own specialist
vocabularies, particularly where these are widely used; for
example, a biomedical version might need to type concepts
that are genes, enzymes, proteins, etc. However domain
specific extensions of this type were not attempted in the
generic prototype discussed in this paper.
To illustrate discourse ontology links in use, we will
examine some claim triples based on arguments presented
in Borodin et al.'s paper ''Finding Authorities and Hubs
From Link Structures on the World Wide Web''.3 These
claims were produced by the first author during the
modeling phase of the case study reported in Section 5
and are also presented in Fig. 3.

General and label is about. It expresses a topic membership
relation. This sort of relationship tends to be indicated
quite early in papers when authors are indicating the
domain they are addressing. For example, the abstract of
Borodin et al.'s paper starts with the sentence ''Recently,
there have been a number of algorithms proposed for
analyzing hypertext link structure so as to determine the
best ''authorities'' for a given topic or query''. They are
helpful in Claim networks as the topic node gives an entry

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">The second triple (B in Fig. 3) uses a link labeled is
different to with type Similarity and negative polarity. It
expresses a negative similarity relation, i.e. it says that
''TKC effect'' and ''SALSA behaviour'' are not the same.
In the original paper, one of the places where this claim is
expressed reads as follows: ''Specifically, when computing
the top authorities, the Kleinberg algorithm tends to
concentrate on a ''tightly knit community'' of nodes (the</zone>

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">The third triple (C in Fig. 3) uses a link with type Causal
and the label is capable of causing. One of the sources for
this claim in the paper reads: ''ythese examples seem
indicative of the topic drift potential of the principal
eigenvector in the Kleinberg algorithm''. This is an example
of how the discourse ontology constrains the modeler, here
to make a claim which is rather stronger than that in the
original paper. How should we read causal statements in
Scholonto? We have stated that we wish to deal with
models of the arguments people make, rather than
propositions about the world (see requirement 2). Yet this
claim looks on the surface like a proposition that could
take a truth-value. However, if we add in the metadata
stored for claims about the creator and backing paper, the
claim could be read as: Uren states, that Kleinberg claims,
that ''TKC effect-algorithm favours tight knit communities''
is capable of causing ''topic drift''. The claim as a
whole is able to be used as a node within other claims; for
example, a claim about a (hypothetical) rebuttal made by
Kleinberg or another reader/modeller's interpretation of
the same text.
Fig. 3 shows the three claims above in the context of the
claim network in which they were created. The arrangement
is dominated by the claim highlighted in the centre of
the model: ''TKC effect-algorithm favours tightly knit

  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">3. Related work
3.1. Hypertext</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">It is widely recognized that hypertext was shaped by the
Memex vision of Bush (1945) and the NLS system of
Engelbart (1962). It is less commonly known that both of
these pioneers saw the construction and analysis of
scholarly arguments as key applications of their technologies,
as discussed in Buckingham Shum (2003). The work
described here can thus be traced back to Bush and
Engelbart, via the extensive research in the 1980s and early
1990s into hypertext graphical argumentation tools and
more recent work on scholarly hypermedia (for a review
see Buckingham Shum, 2005). Bush proposed the idea of
''associative trails'', or chains of documents linked by
associations similar to the associations in human memory.
We propose ScholOnto claim networks as a method of
signposting these trails through a document collection such
as the Internet. This progression from the closed pre-Web
argumentation systems to the Internet increases the scale of
the user community proportionally.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">3.2. Semantic annotation</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Recent years have seen the early stages of the development
of the Semantic Web, in which web pages with
machine interpretable mark up provide the source material
with which agents and semantic web services operate
(Berners-Lee et al., 2001). The commentary offered by the
ScholOnto approach could be viewed as a form of semantic
annotation of documents. The W3C annotation project
Annotea (Kahan et al., 2001) and CREAM (Handschuh
and Staab, 2002), an annotation framework being developed
at the University of Karlsruhe, offer alternative
infrastructures for managing mark-up of this kind.
Annotea applies the W3C open standards for annotating
XML and HTML documents and assumes the Web as the
environment. CREAM applies the same standards but is
aimed a knowledge management environment, such as
company intranets, where a lot of data may be stored in
databases or other non-web-native forms and where more
control of annotation quality may be desired (and
possible).</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">3.3. Concept mapping</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">The use of familiar metaphors is essential when
presenting new technologies to users to reduce the barrier
to uptake. In designing the representational scheme for the
Scholarly Ontologies project we sought familiar sensemaking
methods that link ideas. The Mind Maps developed by
Buzan (1989) are well established as a sensemaking method
in education and business. Mind Maps typically have the
main topic in the centre of the map with subtopics and subsubtopics
radiating off like seeds on the head of a
dandelion. However the focus on a central concept is too
restricting a practice for sensemaking in research literatures,
where people may explore several inter-related topics
and so the fundamentally hierarchical Mind Map method</zone>
  <zone label="MET_TYPE">ARTICLE IN PRESS</zone>

  <zone label="GEN_OTHER">425</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">would not be appropriate. Therefore we took an approach
which is more akin to the concept mapping method
proposed by Novak and Gowin (1984). In concept
mapping the concepts are linked into networks, rather
than hierarchies, giving more freedom to express the
interrelations between ideas. The notion of labelling links,
which is widely used in concept mapping, is also important.
However, because we wanted to be able to construct
services using our links, we needed to have a degree of
control over the kinds of links modellers would use and
support the reuse of structures via a server.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">3.4. Link vocabularies</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">In developing this vocabulary of link types we were
aware of a trade-off between usability and expressiveness.
Users may be wary of a very complex system, preferring
not to use it rather than be seen to make a ''mistake''. On
the other hand very simple systems impose too many
constraints on the types of models users can build.
Therefore while we drew on theoretical work such as that
on Cognitive Coherence Relations (Knott and Mellish,
1996; Knott and Sanders, 1998) we took a pragmatic
approach to selecting relations, aiming for a moderate
palette of useful links rather than a very complete set such
as that proposed by Trigg (1983). Since then Gil and
Ratnakar have published work on the TRELLIS system
(Gil and Ratnakar, 2002) which also uses discourse
relations. We note that they too selected relations that
could be understood by users, rather than ''precise'' or
''complete'' relations. Selected examples of discourse
relations used in Trellis include: provides background for,
in contrast with, is solved by, is motivation for, depends on
and causes.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">3.5. Citation classification</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">There are parallels between the typing of links and the
typing of citations. Since citation databases first became
available authors have proposed systems for categorising
authors' motives and/or the rhetorical role citations play,
e.g. Lipetz (1965), Weinstock (1971), Murugesan and
Moravcsik (1978), Duncan et al. (1981) and Garzone and
Mercer (2000). While these schemes are varied they share
common elements, such as corroborating/affirmative,
negational/correcting, methodology, background/assumed
knowledge, which we recognize also among the relational
types of our own ontology and Gil's. We are convinced
that citation indexes would be greatly improved by this
kind of typing and are investigating its application in other
projects. However to be economic it must be automated
and this is a substantial challenge for natural language
researchers. Much of the automatic classification of
citations carried out to date has been aimed at document
summarisation and argumentative zoning (finding the parts
of papers that play different roles) rather than directly at
citation classification, e.g. Nanba and Okumura (1999) and
Teufel and Moens (2000). It is an interesting observation
that these authors employ very basic categorisation
schemes of just three or four key types. Nanba and
Okumura have
Type B-the references to base on other researchers'
theories or methods, Type C-the references to compare
with related works or to point out their problems, Type
O-the references other than types B and C,
whereas Teufel and Moens have Background, Other work,
Weakness/Contrast and Own contribution. By contrast,
Mercer et al. are investigating textual cues to mark up a
two tier system with 34 base types divided between 10
upper categories (Mercer and Di Marco, 2004).
We are convinced that citation indexes would be greatly
improved by this kind of typing. Although at present, it is
fair to say that these techniques are still in a relatively early
state of development. Apart from providing an automated
technique to apply to a specific document corpus (once
properly trained), the key difference to our approach is that
the granularity of our work is the claim, as opposed to the
document. The complementarity between the two approaches
hold potential, however, and Sereno et al.
(2005) have reported the evaluation of a prototype system
which applies Teufel and Moens' (2002) argumentative
zoning and other information extraction techniques to
more actively support the task of detecting and annotating,
potentially significant claims in documents.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">4. The tools</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Three prototype tools were used in the case study
reported in Section 5 of this paper. The first is ClaiMapper,
a sketching tool that supports users in making sense of the
claims in papers. When the user is satisfied with part or
entire claim network produced in ClaiMapper it can be
imported into the second tool ClaiMaker. This is a digital
library server that connects claims via hyperlinks to the
documents they describe and provides search services to
help users explore large claim networks. The third tool is
ClaimFinder. This is an alternative interface to ClaimMaker,
designed for use by novices, which contains the
simpler search functions presented more accessibly.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">4.1. ClaiMapper argument sketching tool</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">The first prototype for building claim networks was a
form-filling interface which can be accessed directly
through the ClaiMaker server. This interface has one form
to create Concepts, another to create Sets and a variety of
forms for creating different kinds of Claims. This was a
quick route to allow the research team to start populating
the database with claims in order to put the ontology
through its paces and create a collection for testing
services, but it did not provide much sensemaking support
to modellers. For instance, while the project team did

on the interface, they reported difficulty holding a gestalt
view of the model in their heads as they went through the
dissociated steps of building Concepts and Sets, then
assembling them into Claims. It was clear that some radical
changes were needed to the interface if it was to support the
cognitive processes involved in creating claim networks.
In order to overcome the problems of holding complex
models in memory, the project team sometimes found
themselves resorting to pen and paper for sketching out
drafts of argument maps. An extreme example showing a
paper-based concept network describing several papers is
shown in Fig. 4: each sheet of paper has a sketch of the
claims in one paper, the arrows drawn between sheets on
the white board represent claims which use concepts from
two different papers. This sketching stage was adopted in
part because the form-filling interface had no correction
facility. It prevented users from deleting or modifying a
concept which might meanwhile have been included in
someone else's model. However it was mainly driven by a
desire to refine the user's own interpretation before
committing it to the knowledge base. In the terms of
Green's cognitive dimensions analysis the interface was
''enforcing premature structure'' (Green, 1990; Shipman
and Marshall, 1999), by making the users commit a
structure before they were comfortable that they had made
sense of what they were reading.
It was clear that a new interface should offer better
support for this sketching stage, which enables the
refinement part of the sensemaking process. It therefore
had to assist the process of sketching draft maps and
reviewing new structures in context before committing
them to the knowledge base. This was implemented by
modifying Compendium, a hypertext visual modelling
tool.4 The result was a desktop sketching tool called
ClaiMapper in which a small number of icon conventions
are used to produce visualisations of concepts and the
connections between them.
The ClaiMapper conventions are illustrated in Fig. 5.
The right pane is an open document that contains two
concepts (represented by the orb icon) and a set, which
contains two other concepts (represented by the bullet list
icon with the subscript 2 indicating the number of concepts
contained in the set). These are linked to form two Claim
triples. A Claim triple comprises two objects joined by a
directed, labelled link. We refer to the objects conventionally
as the left- and right-hand objects, the left hand being
the place the link comes from and the right hand the place
it links to. Of the claims in Fig. 5, one has on the left hand
the set and on the right hand one of the concepts linked by
the relation is analogous to. The second claim has on the
left hand the concept labelled One Claim can contain
another and on the right hand the whole of the first Claim
triple (represented by the is similar to link pointing to the
centre of the is analogous to link). Using ClaiMapper in this
way we can clearly visualize the nesting described in
Section 2.1.

ment of their ideas. For example, the left window in Fig. 5
is being used as if it were a folder to hold a collection of
documents on the same topic.
While the user works in the ClaiMapper environment
they can edit the structures they build at will. However in
order to access the interpretational services provided by
ClaiMaker they will eventually have to decide that their
interpretation of a particular document is ''good enough''
to be uploaded to a private or shared database. At this
point the structures that have been uploaded are synchronized
with the server by being given unique IDs (see
Fig. 15b, IDs are numbers in angle brackets). Subsequently
ClaiMapper prevents editing of those structures, for
example, changing a label, which would cause a mismatch
with the server version. The user is still free to link to them,
in which case the additional claims can be uploaded to the
server. Structures can also be deleted from the ClaiMapper
version, since the server version does not require users to
have a full copy of the server model on their local machine
it will not detect an error. The user can also download their
own and other modellers' structures from the server for use
in ClaiMapper.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">4.2. ClaiMaker server software</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">The ClaiMaker server combines a number of roles. It
supports model building, through the original form-based
interface and through model upload via XML files
exported by ClaiMapper. It also provides a range of
search, visualisation and discovery services. Implementing
ClaiMaker as a server application has a number of
practical advantages. In the development stage it facilitated
getting new versions to early adopters; changes
made to the server are available to users without them
having to regularly update their local software. It also
gave the project team access to the models people built
allowing us to assess the modeling scheme and identify
difficulties. Uploading claims once to a server is a much
easier way for a distributed group of collaborators to
share their annotations than circulating files of annotations
which each member of the group must upload
individually to view them. Finally, to support ClaiMaker's
role as a digital library system, the choice of a server, in
which links can be made to digital resources via URLs, is
obvious.
The data (Concepts, Sets, Claims, bibliographic metadata,
etc.) are stored in a MySQL database which underlies
all the functions. A mirror of the database in RDF was also
maintained at one stage on a Lisp server. This allowed us
to experiment with services that exploited the structure in
the link ontology to a greater extent. We were able to
develop some interesting services using this technology,
e.g., lineage, which will be discussed further below.
However, we found that the technical difficulties of
maintaining two intercommunicating servers were too
great for us (and probably for potential users as well).
Consequently we found ways to recast these services as
complex SQL statements that replicate most of the
functionality of the RDF-based search.
We will not describe the model building functions of
ClaiMaker, since the form-based interfaces it uses have
been largely superseded by the sketching technology used
in ClaiMapper. We will concentrate instead on the search,
visualisation and discovery functions. Later we will
demonstrate how some of these functions were used to
analyse the claim network produced using ClaiMapper.

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">4.2.1. Search
ClaiMaker has a basic set of services that allow the user
to find documents, concepts, sets and links by searching for
title text, author, creator, creation date, etc. As a first step
these give tabular listings of the type shown in Figs. 6 and
7. From these listings further information about the objects
returned can be found using the icons located with them.
These open supplementary information boxes that overlay
the main listing. Working from left to right on the concepts
in Fig. 6 the ''i'' icon will bring up further information
about the concept itself (who created it, when, any further
details input by the creator, etc.). The ''anchor'' icon sets
this concept as the focal node in a Neighbourhood search
(described shortly). The document node gives the bibliographic
details of the document that backs the concept up
and a hyperlink to the original. The final ''person'' icon
gives details of the person who created the object.
The listing for links (see Fig. 7) shows for each claim the
two objects that are joined in the first and third columns
with an arrow icon between them. The same icon set is used
to access additional information and the colour of the
arrow depends upon the properties of the link so that red
links represent links with negative polarity and green links
have strong weight and positive polarity (the rest are gold).
Referring back to Table 2, ''improves on'' is shown with a
green arrow, ''is different to'' with a red arrow and less

  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">4.2.2. Visualisation</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">In addition to the tabular layout search results which
contain claims can be viewed using interactive views
generated using the TouchGraph5 visualisation package.
For example Fig. 8 is a TouchGraph rendering of search
results. The visualisation can be explored by the user via
the locality, zoom and rotate functions, or filtered by link
type using the menu shown. Further information on nodes
in the display can be accessed by hovering over a node and
selecting ''details'', as shown.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">4.2.3. Discovery</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Developing discovery services has been a core activity
within the Scholarly Ontologies project. Traditional
information retrieval systems use term-based search and
search via citations. Term-based search handles documents
as isolated entities defined by the words in them. Citations
in a document do give an indication of the links between
documents but there are many motives for citing and a
reference list gives no indication of authors' intentions in
referring to other work. We generally cannot even tell if a
paper is referenced because the authors support it or are
diametrically opposed to it, although interesting research is
being done to improve this situation (see Section 3).
In this section, we describe four of the discovery services
that we have developed. The examples of discovering the
neighbourhood and discovering chains, demonstrate services
to assist the user in exploring and navigating the
topologies of argument maps. The examples of discovering
disagreement and discovering lineage demonstrate how the
explicit connections embedded in the discourse ontology
can be used to build services that assist the user in
answering common research questions, e.g. ''Where did
this idea come from?'' A typical discovery service
comprises a search of the claims network followed by a
presentation of results (which may be a visualisation)
tailored to the particular question.
4.2.3.1. Discovering the neighbourhood. The Neighbourhood
search, which can be reached from tabular results
listings via the anchor icon gives answers to the question
''What is directly related to this?'' It allows the user to
examine all the claims made with one or more chosen
object/s on either the left- or the right-hand side. The focal
concepts can be searched for using a keyword search, or a
search for all the concepts in a particular paper, or by
picking up an anchor icon from a previous results listing, or
by picking up an anchor icon from one of the left-or righthand
column headings in the neighbourhood table which
selects all the concepts in that column as focal concepts.
The focal concepts are listed in the central column of the
neighbourhood listing (see Fig. 9). Because it embeds the

similarities to neighbourhood but allows the user to specify
more parameters, for example the length of chains to be
found and their direction, by filling in slots in a simple
form. Fig. 10 presents an example of the output of this

4.2.3.3. Discovering disagreement. Consider a common
question that many researchers bring to a literature: ''What
arguments are there against this paper?'' Despite the
centrality of the notion of disagreement in the assessment
of evidence, there is not even a language in which to
articulate such a query to a digital library. With our
ontology modelling the world of scholarly discourse, we
can begin to express the basic idea that researchers
disagree; it is the idea embedded in the property negative
polarity.
How can we operationalize such a query? First, we are
looking for arguments against, which map on to the
ontology as relations of any type with negative polarity.
At a trivial level, this paper corresponds to the currently
selected document in ClaiMaker. But more substantively,
this paper refers to the claims that researchers have made
about the document, specifically, the concepts linked to it.
Moreover, we can extend this to related concepts, using the
following definition: the extended set of concepts linked by a
positive relation to/from the document's immediate concepts,
i.e., discovering chains of disagreement or agreement.
For the given document, this discovery service does the
following:</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">1. Finds the concepts associated with that paper.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">2. Extends the set of concepts by adding positively linked
concepts from other papers.
3. Finds concepts that link to these with negative relations.
4. Returns the concepts from step 3 as concepts against the
extended concept set.
This approach has dangers. It does not follow that if A is
in agreement with B and B is in disagreement with C then
A must be in disagreement with C also. However it should
be remembered that this is a search service. It is up to the
user to judge whether the claims returned are valid.
Typical results are presented in Fig. 11. Note the two
numbers to the right of the claim that disagrees with one of
the related issues in the query. The first (8621) is a
hyperlink to the metadata of the paper that provides the
backing for the claim, which includes a URL to the paper
itself. The second (2) is a link to the personal details of the
modeller who made the claim; this allows the user to make
a judgement about the credentials of the claim: can it be
trusted?
4.2.3.4. Discovering lineage. A common activity in research
is clarifying where a particular idea came from and
what other ideas influenced its development. We call this
the lineage behind an idea. Lineage is the notion that ideas
build on each other and has an inverse, the descendant,
which is the notion that ideas are spawned by a particular
seminal notion. Where the paths have become increasingly
indirect over time or been confused, uncovering unexpected
or surprising lineage is a major scholarly contribution. We
have a more modest goal to start with in ClaiMaker: to
provide a tool pick out from the 'spaghetti' of claims,
candidate streams of ideas that conceptually appear to be
building on each other.
In practice, our lineage tool tracks back (semantically,
not in time) from a concept to see how it evolved, whereas</zone>

the descendants tool tracks forward from a concept to see
what new ideas evolved from it. Since descendants are the
inverse of lineage (and are implemented as its literal
inverse) we will only discuss lineage. A lineage can be
conceptualized as a path in which the links suggest
development or improvement (Fig. 12).
The constraints are chosen to reflect the ideas of
improvement and development. The set of permitted link
types comprises the two general links uses/applies/is
enabled by or improves on and links of type similarity and
positive polarity. The improves on link type is included to
reflect the notion of improvement, while uses/applies/is
enabled by has the weaker implication of development. The
similarity links are included because if a new concept is like
a second that improves on a third concept, then the new
concept is likely to be an improvement on the third concept
as well. The problem of finding lineage in ClaiMaker can
then be formulated as a path-matching problem, a wellknown
problem in graph theory, which searches for paths
(sequences) of links that follow a specific pattern. The first
prototype of the lineage service used an RDF representation
of the argument maps and the Ivanhoe path matcher
embedded in the Wilbur RDF Parser (Lassila, 2001). This
approach is described in our other papers: Buckingham
Shum et al. (2003) and Uren et al. (2003). Due to
operational difficulties with supporting a Lisp server in
parallel with the ClaiMaker server this approach was later
dropped and we adopted a slightly weaker approach to
lineage based on a chain search with the links going away
from the home node, pruned using constraints based on the
link ontology. The descendants algorithm is the same
except that the links in the chain are directed towards the
home node.
The procedure is as follows:
(1) The user inputs a home node H and a number of steps
N, the maximum length of lineage they wish to search
through.
(2) Find all links in the direction away from H (H is the
left-hand side of the triple) that meet the set of</zone>

constraints (type similarity and positive polarity,
improves on, uses/applies/is enabled by).
(3) Define the output set H' containing all the terminal
nodes of the paths found in step 2.
(4) Eliminate from H' any nodes that have been encountered
before in this search.
(5) For each node in H' repeat steps 2 and 3 and build a
new set of terminal nodes to search from.
(6) Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a total of N cycles have been
completed.
Two things were lost in the MySQL implementation,
compared to the first RDF-based prototype. The first is
that we can no longer handle similarity links as symmetric
links, i.e. we can no longer ignore their direction. The
second is that, because MySQL has poor facilities for
recursion by comparison with Lisp, the user must now set
the maximum number of links they wish to see in a chain.</zone>

Summary of topics covered by the case study review
Link-based analysis methods
Scientometrics, the study of scientific research literature using citation data, has been used to study the development of ideas and identify emerging topics
for some years(White and McCain, 1989; van Raan, 1997). The process generally involves the selection of a body of citation data in a field of interest,
followed by computation to identify structures of interest, which are then analysed by an expert to interpret what the structures mean in terms of the
development of the field.
Scientometrics overlaps with the study of social networks, which models nets of relationships between people (Pool and Kochen, 1978/79), via coauthorship
studies. In this case, the relationship link is made if two authors have published together and may be weighted according to the number of coauthored
publications.
The extension of scientometric practices to analyse the World Wide Web, sometimes called Webometrics, is being actively explored, although not without
caveats concerning the signification of hyperlinks (Cronin, 2001). For scholarly hyperlinks, studies have shown that researchers motives for hyperlinking
are closely related to their existing citation behaviour (Kim, 2000). Therefore it may be reasonable to assume that scholarly hyperlinks are suitable for
scientometric study.
This view is reinforced by the successful development of Web ranking algorithms that exploit information about the links between Web pages, e.g.,
PageRank (Page et al., 1998) and HITS (Kleinberg, 1999). Using link information as part of the ranking strategy is considered advantageous because links
from domains other than a page's home domain represent some kind of human endorsement of the content.</zone>

the topics is given in Table 3.
A number of motives influenced this choice:
The field was characterized by the common theme of
link analysis.
Citation studies and co-authorship studies are wellestablished
methods of literature analysis.
Web-based link analysis is currently a hot topic in
information retrieval.
The topic seemed likely to inform our own research on
claim networks.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">5.1. Sketching and refining interpretation with ClaiMapper</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">In the first phase of the evaluation we used ClaiMapper
and ClaiMaker to build a claim network. The first author
undertook the review and initial modelling of the literature
in ClaiMapper. By the end of this process some 290+
nodes, 340+ links and 64 document nodes had been
created. Ideally, we would have like to have had the Claim
Network built by a neutral third party. However, since the
person who built the review had to be familiar with the
tools and willing to commit several weeks of working time,
we were constrained to select one of ourselves.
It was observed that the overall sensemaking process
with ClaiMapper fell into three cycles, which overlapped
and followed in sequence, but with backtracking
(see Fig. 14). The initial cycle is the Gather-Read-Categorize
cycle, in which a collection of potentially useful
material was obtained, scanned and roughly sorted into
topics. The middle cycle is the Read-Model-Categorize
cycle. Here the papers were studied in more detail, the
arguments were mapped and refinements were made to the
categories used. The final cycle was the Model-ReflectWrite
cycle, in which the claim networks were used to draft
summaries on each of the topics. Backtracking occurred,
e.g., when writing and reflecting opened up new questions
which required more documents to be gathered.
ClaiMapper provided a space in which to sketch rough
ideas, then refine them. It was found that, in this case

study, the degree of order in the models seemed to increase
over time. For example, in Fig. 15a the first screen shot is
taken from a backup of the ClaiMapper database taken at
a relatively early stage, roughly at the end of the first
Gather-Read-Categorize cycle, whereas the second screenshot
(Fig. 15b) was taken after several Read-Categorize-Model
cycles, while writing was in progress.
In Fig. 15a, the Home Window: is being used as a scribble
pad. Concepts of interest are dotted about and linked to each
other and to documents, some represent research articles while
others are being used as containers to organize material,
rather like a folder in a hierarchical file system. One of these
containers has been opened; and contains one document and a
series of unconnected concepts. At this point, the structure has
some of the aspects of an argument model, related ideas have
been joined up at the upper level, but it is largely mnemonic: a
sketch of ideas that arose from the initial scan and deserve
further investigation.
By the time the screenshot in Fig. 15b was taken, the
structure of the models had become more organized. The
Home Window now contains just eight documents, each of
which is acting as a container for documents on a particular
topic. The containers have been organized into a shallow
hierarchy with ''bibliometrics'' at the top. One of these
container documents has been opened. It contains an
unconnected list of documents each of which represents an
actual article. The right hand small pane shows the
argument model for one of these articles. This is expressed
using the constraints of the ontology described above and
is a machine-interpretable structure that could be uploaded
to ClaiMaker as a representation of this document.
We can see in this process that ClaiMapper was able to
support the refinement aspect of sensemaking. It appears
that as the modeller learnt more about the topic and
became more committed to her interpretation of the data, a
crystallisation process occurred in which the models
became more organized and clear categories emerged. It
is a classic example of the move from rough sketches to
coherent argument, a phenomenon reported both in
empirical studies of designers using argumentation-based
design rationale and empirical studies of the use of
computer-supported writing tools, reviewed in (Buckingham
Shum and Hammond, 1994).
The use of documents as containers in which to subdivide
papers by category in this case study may have arisen from
the multi-disciplinary nature of the task. This is an
interesting example of affordances of the system emerging
that were not designed in as functions. One reason that
documents could stand in as containers is that ClaiMapper
permits transclusion,6 so papers which bridged categories
6In Hypertext research, 'transclusion' is a term invented by Ted Nelson
for the republishing of the same content in multiple contexts, such that the
system treats the material correctly and the end-user is aware of the reuse.
In ClaiMapper (and Compendium on which it is based) transclusion
manifests as nodes which can be edited directly from any of their contexts,
which display where they are transcluded and support quick navigation
between these contexts. See Selvin and Buckingham Shum (2005) for an</zone>

The hierarchy shown in Fig. 15b was used to provide the
sectioning for the first draft of the review. This sectioning
was changed later because it did not give sufficient
emphasis to the cross disciplinary threads that made the
review interesting. However it provided the structure for an
initial ''divide and conquer'' step in the writing process, in
which topic summaries could be produced simply by
looking at the documents in a particular ''folder''.</zone>

  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">5.2. Comparative evaluation</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">The second phase of the evaluation comprised a
comparative analysis of the two artefacts produced in
phase one, namely the Claim network and the traditional
written review. We wanted to determine whether the Claim
network, in combination with ClaiMaker and ClaimFinder,
could be used to communicate similar information to
that in the written review. This is the first step in validating
Claim networks as a collaborative tool-demonstrating
that one person can understand another's model. A factual
questionnaire was used as the instrument of the study. In
particular, we wanted to look at the overall quality of the
students' answers, how they handled individual questions
and which features of the search tools the claim network
group used to find answers.
There are some confounding factors in the design of this
experiment. As we have already commented, ideally the
artefacts should have been built by a neutral third party.
However this was infeasible. Also the quality of both the
claim network and the review were likely to influence the
quality of the answers that the students gave. However, the
question we were seeking to answer was not very complex.
It was simply whether claim networks could communicate
information to people other than the creator. The review
group give a point of comparison but differences between
the media, the history of their preparation (the review was
written after and based on the claim network and the
questionnaire was written last) and the fact that it was
impossible to make the content of the two artefacts
identical force us to be cautious about the significance of
any differences in the performance of the two groups.
The participants in the study were six research students
studying in KMi. None of them had prior, in-depth
knowledge of the topics in the literature selected for the
study. Half the group was engaged in research related to
discourse mapping and literature analysis. These three were
all familiar with the ScholOnto discourse ontology and the
ideas underlying claim networks but were not particularly
familiar with the tools. These students were assigned to the
Claim Network group. The remaining three students were
assigned to the Written Review group and worked with a
document of about 2300 words in length. It was not

considered detrimental to the study to use the students with
knowledge of the principles of claim networks to use the
tools, since we wished to investigate a scenario in which the
basic ideas and instrumental operations were known (just
as members of the Written Review group were familiar
with reading, pens and paper). Even after deliberately
selecting students with some knowledge of claim networks
the bias of experience of the medium used still favours the
Written Review group.
A questionnaire was written which could, in principle, be
answered using the information provided by either artefact
(see Table 4). A testing station was set up with the
Camtasia7 screen capture tool to record the participants'
interactions with the tools and their verbal comments.
While the verbal comments were not used heavily in the
analysis reported here, the comments of the claim network
group were a valuable source of qualitiative data to
understand why they were pursuing particular strategies
and to identify design flaws and bugs in the interface.
Participants were accompanied by an observer who could
assist with any general queries they had about the exercise
and who also provided someone to ''think aloud'' to. The
questionnaire was presented on screen to facilitate timing
how long it took to answer each question. Camtasia
recorded participants as they added or edited their answers
in this online version and the time taken on each question
was estimated from verbal comments and time spent
inputting answers. The Claim Network group was given
a Microsoft Internet Explorer Web browser with links set
up to both ClaiMaker and ClaimFinder. The Written
Review group had an open Microsoft Word document
containing the review, plus a hard copy version since many
people prefer to read on paper.

  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">5.2.1. The questionnaire and correctness scoring system</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Subjects were required to answer the questions listed in
Table 4. The aim of the questionnaire design was to cover a
spread of the topics in the domain and to give questions
that ranged in complexity from extracting facts to
demonstrating some understanding of the topics. Taking
some examples: question 2 concerns the topic of link
ranking only and simply requires the participant to identify
some names of algorithms, question 6 concerns both
scientometrics and the Web and expects the participant
to be able to identify issues that are problems and question
10 concerns all the topics and requires the user to form an
overview of them. The openness and complexity of the
questions tends to increase towards the end of the
questionnaire to give students the opportunity to acquire
some knowledge of the domain.
To assess the correctness of the results, we constructed a
''gold standard'' set of answers by merging the answers of
the three individuals who tested the questionnaire prior to
the study. These were the first author, who had access to
the review and the claim network, the second author, who
only used the claim network and an experienced research
student who was not part of the research team, who only
used the review. A marking scheme was devised and the
third author, who was not involved in any other part of the
evaluation, marked the answer scripts.
The scoring system was weighted equally across the
questions; it allotted a maximum of two marks per answer,
giving a maximum score of 22. For factual questions, a list
was supplied of all the items listed by the gold standard
group in answers and a suggested mark was allotted for
each item up to a maximum of 2. Question 2, for example,
had half a mark per algorithm up to a maximum of 2
marks. The exception was question 7, which asks for
precisely three properties In this case a bonus half-mark
was awarded if the participant gave exactly three. For the
more open questions the marker had to use some discretion
and judge how well argued the answer was and whether it
included reference to any of the issues raised by the testers.
We also recorded the times participants took to answer
individual questions to determine their relative difficulty.
The decision of a participant to move from one question to
another was a cognitive process which could not always be
timed with precision. The timings were therefore measured
in minutes and rounded up. Minutes gave sufficient
accuracy to get a feel for the relative difficulty of questions,
which was our main aim.
5.2.2. Results
Our analysis of the data in the Camtasia movies and the
students' answers to questions covered several aspects.
Correctness and actual time taken to answer questions gave
us an indication of the comparable difficulty of the two
tasks (review or claim network). The per question analysis
of relative time taken and answers given helped us
understand whether there were affordances of the two
artefacts which were advantageous in particular situations.

We gave special attention to the questions which required
the participants to interpret the material they were given.
An analysis of how the participants in the Claim Network
group used the available interfaces informed us about
which services were found to be most helpful.
5.2.2.1. Task difficulty. Table 5 clearly shows that the
Written Review group was able to answer the questions
faster than the Claim Network group. This was to be
expected for several reasons. First the review has ''added
value'' over the claim network: it was written by the
researcher based on her understanding of the topics built
up by constructing the claim network. Secondly, members
of the Written Review group were far more familiar with
the medium they were working with (essentially a reading
comprehension test) than members of the Claim Network
group. It was observed that all the members of the Written
Review group used the printed version as their main
resource and the version on the computer as an occasional
look up. It would be unreasonable to expect similar ease of
use with unfamiliar tools in comparison to a skill which the
Written Review group had been practising for many years.
Furthermore, the review was quite short, only about 2300
words. This was necessary to allow the Written Review
group to read it and complete the questionnaire under
experimental conditions. However, it is possible that if the
review had been longer (e.g. 23,000 rather than 2300
words) the search and exploration services available to the
Claim Network group would have given them an
advantage.
The variability in the times taken by the Claim Network
group was far greater than for the Written Review group.
This seemed to be largely due to their personal style of
question answering, in particular, the slowest participant
had a very analytical approach to both the questions and
the data in the claims.
We also observed that the Claim Network group
generally gave far more ''thinking aloud'' contributions,
which was an additional distractor and tended to increase
actual time to answer questions. The reluctance of the
Written Review participants to think aloud may stem from
the strong habit of reading silently. Breaking that silence to
comment on questions is a barrier.</zone>

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Fig. 16. Relative time to answer questions and correctness score per question.
Finally, the difference in correctness between the two
groups' answers was small; the review group scored 1.4
more on average, a difference of about 6%. This difference
is not particularly large, suggesting that the claim network
can be understood by people other than the creator.</zone>

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">chart the proportion of question answering time spent for
each question and in the table the score of each participant
on each question. For the review participants consideration
was given to the fairest way to deal with reading time.
Alternative approaches we considered were: to ignore it
and start timing at the first point at which the participant
started to address a question, to divide reading time equally
between the questions (which seemed intuitively wrong), or
to portion out the reading time across the questions in
proportion to the amount of time spent on questions
(which results in no change compared to ignoring reading
time). The decision was complicated by the fact that only
one of the group began the exercise by reading the review
all the way through while other two started to answer some
questions before they had finished reading the whole
document. Consequently, we decided to opt for the first
and simplest method which has the additional advantage of
being most directly comparable with the times for the
Claim Network group who did not have a reading period.
These were calculated to remove the effect of personal
style; for example, within the Claim Network group actual
times were very variable. Relative time per question
provides an indicator as to whether members of one group
found certain questions relatively harder to answer than
the other group.
For most of the questions there is no indication from
performance times that one group of participants found
any question noticeably harder than the other group. For
question 4 the Written Review group found it easier to
answer the question than the Claim Network group,
whereas for questions 7 and 9 the latter completed the
task in a relatively shorter time. In terms of correctness,
only question 5 shows a difference between the groups with
the review group all getting perfect scores and the Network
group all scoring 1 or below. We will look at these three
questions in detail.
The Claim Network group found question 4 (''What is
scientometrics?'') relatively harder to answer than the
Written Review group. The latter had little trouble finding
a definition in the first sentence of the section of the review
headed ''scientometrics'' and all copied this into the answer
sheet as ''Scientometrics is the study of scientific research
literature using citation data''. The Claim Network group
took a much more exploratory approach. A similar
definition had been embedded in the notes field of the
node labelled ''scientometrics''. However, none of the
Claim Network group thought to look for it. They knew
that notes existed but most of the nodes did not have them
and there was no visual flag to indicate that this node did
(this is a user interface design flaw highlighted by the
study). Instead they all looked at the nodes immediately
438</zone>
  <zone label="MET_BIB_INFO">ARTICLE IN PRESS
V. Uren et al. / Int. J. Human-Computer Studies 64 (2006) 420-445</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">adjacent to ''scientometrics'' and constructed their answers
from those. These produced some acceptable definitions,
e.g.
From what I understand, scientometrics is a kind of
meta-science, or a discipline, or a research area, that
measures and represents 'discourse' phenomena within
scientific research: for instance, providing a picture of
how discourse develops in a field, through mapping
literature (relations between researchers' work, perspectives,
concepts, discourse acts like publications, etc.). To
use ClaiMaker phrasing, it aims at providing evolutionary
models of science, technology and scholarship.
This definition certainly reflects the background of the
person who wrote it (a student of semiotics and discourse)
but she has clearly formed a personal view of what
scientometrics is. To summarize, while the process was
more time consuming, it could be argued that the members
of the Claim Network group were forced to engage more
with the material and understand it, not having the option
to simply paste the opening sentence conveniently found at
the start of the Written Review.
By contrast it was the Written Review group who had
trouble with question 7 (''Name three properties you would
expect to see in social networks?''). The Claim Network
group were helped by the text of three nodes. They all
searched for nodes that contained the words ''social
networks'' and got these: ''Social networks are assortative'',
''Social networks have a high degree of clustering'' and
''Social networks are divided into groups and communities'',
as shown in Fig. 17.
Two out of three of the Claim Network group turned
these directly into three properties with which to answer
the question. The third decided that clusters were similar to
groups and searched in the neighbourhood of these claims
to extract the property: ''in social networks connections
don't develop randomly''.
The Written Review group had greater difficulty in
picking similar properties from the text. Each had to spend
several minutes reading through the section of the text
headed ''Social networks'' and one of them reported
difficulties with the question. At the end each Written
Review participant produced a rather different list of
properties and only one of them gave a set that was similar
to those reported by the Claim Network group. The
Written Review group had to interpret several paragraphs
of text in order to pick out properties whereas the Claim
Network group had an easy way to answer the question.
These differences come from the way pieces of information
were presented in the two artefacts.
It is of course possible to design either artefact to
highlight particular information, an issue to which we
return in the discussion. However, the relative ease with
which the Claim Network group tackled Question 9 (''Give
the titles of two papers which report on combining
information from Web pages with link analysis algorithms'')
stems from the generic affordances of the online
system. Each Concept is related to a paper whose
bibliographic details are stored within the system. An icon
is presented with each concept that allows the user to open
up a ''details'' box with the reference in it. Having
identified relevant concepts the participants simply had to

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">check the details boxes and extract two different titles. The
review participants had to deal with the familiar difficulties
of matching a reference marker to the reference itself in a
text document, although they mitigated this problem by
doing text searches on authors' names in their online
versions.
Finally, we will look at question 5 (''What does van
Raan consider to be the sub-tasks of scientometrics?''), the
only question for which there was a noticeable difference in
scores between the two groups. In this case this difference
can be explained by features in both artefacts. The written
review had a bullet pointed list summarising van Raan's
analysis. ClaimFinder, on the other hand, only had
facilities for searching on content words not on authors'
names. This had not posed a problem for the testers
because they were both fluent users of ClaiMaker and
simply switched over to the ''expert'' interface to answer
this question. This difference reveals a design flaw in the
novice interface that can be corrected by a simple change in
how the ClaimFinder index is built.
5.2.2.3. Tackling interpretive questions. The first nine
questions were fact-finding tasks. The last two questions
required the participants to consider the material they had
been presented with as a whole. Question 10 (''What
unifying notion is common to scientometrics, social
networks studies and link ranking algorithms?'') required
a synthesis of ideas encountered in answering the previous
nine questions. The two groups showed quite different
approaches to tackling this question. Two of the Claim
Network group assumed there was some mechanism for
tracing a path between concepts in the tool. In fact this
facility did not exist and they ended up doing extensive
searches of the neighbourhood of each concept trying to
''manually'' identify a Concept that was linked to all of
them. One participant gave up when he could not find such
a concept. The other two found the Concept ''Cognitive and
socio-organisational structures in science and technology''
which is joined directly to both the ''scientometrics'' and
''social networks'' Concepts (Fig. 18). This helped each of
them to start formulating an answer.
The Written Review participants knew there was no
''magic button'' they could press and that they would have
to generate an answer from their own interpretation of the
review. Their answers all drew on the idea of clustering and
communities, ideas which had been mentioned in several
sections of the review. Thus, on a high level, both groups
produced answers about the identification of patterns, but
in slightly different ways.
Question 11 is perhaps the most fundamental of the
questions we asked and the most open-ended. Would the
participants be able to identify open research questions
using the information in the artefacts? As research students
they had all been engaged in identifying research questions
in their own domains but none of them specialized in the
specific topics addressed in this study. Nor would one
normally expect students to start formulating research
questions after only being exposed to a domain for an hour
or so. Therefore we did not expect particularly welldeveloped
replies. We also expected that although the

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Research question proposed in response to question 11
I'd have a look at the problems or shortcomings identified in one of these areas. For instance: I could work on clustering
decays and try to reduce them. They are an important part of social networks and their reduction could increase the
deployment of social network. Why? Because someone has said that they were an issue for social network. So why not
tackle it?
If my criteria was based on the amount of information available, I would have to choose the social networks aspect. This
seemed to have been the best-covered topic in the database. In terms of personal interest and background knowledge I
would have to choose the scientometrics aspect. The aspect I would least likely undertake would be the link ranking
algorithms since this has a lot of terms that are not very familiar and not well defined in the database.
If I wanted to study social networks on the web, I would try to look into the way people use links and express patterns of
link use (paths). This would interest me because I think it would help me to identify people's thinking, and the way they
interpret what they find, through the series of connections that they follow.
Social networks probably because it would inform the others.
I would be interested in research on social networks that evolve over time and that can be used for providing estimations of
the importance of documents. Social networks and small-networks in particular appear to have attracted the interest of
many researchers from various disciplines.
All of these methods rely on exploiting explicit links between papers. What appears to be missing is the reason for the
reference. Once the network has been built and displayed graphically, it may be possible to use deeper NLP techniques to
identify types of reference. A reference may be given for many reasons such as identifying the originator of some notion,
theory or claim. A reference may be given because the particular work fills a gap revealed by another or it contradicts the
other claim. It may be possible to deduce the nature of the citation on the fly when a reader is interested. Alternatively, this
could be done for each citation which would be computationally expensive, but demonstrate different structures such as the
genealogy of ideas or controversies, etc.
answers would be found partly in the material we
presented, they might also relate to the students' own
characters, interests and experience, since researchers'
worldviews affect which questions they choose to ask and
even find meaningful (Reich, 1994).
As a consequence of these factors we did not expect the
participants to give similar answers to Question 11. Our
aim was first and foremost to see if they could give any
answers and secondarily to make a judgment of how useful
their answers were. The answers the students gave are
presented in Table 6.
All but one of the participants (D) produced a fairly
complex answer. Participant D's answer, ''Social networks
probably because it would inform the others'', is certainly
not a foolish one. The student has realized that the papers
researchers choose to cite and the pages they choose to
make Web links to are partly social behaviours and that
this could be an interesting thing to look at.
Some of the other answers demonstrate misconceptions
on the part of the participants. For example, in A's
question, the statement ''I could work on clustering
decays'' comes from a search to look for problems that
had been identified in the network as a stimulus for
forming a research question. This brought up, among
others the Concept ''clustering coefficient decays with time'',
the word ''decays'' has negative connotations generally,
but in this case it refers only to the decrease in a numerical
measure of clustering observed in social networks as they
grow. While it would be possible to study its causes, it is
unlikely that the decay could be influenced significantly.
Errors such as this and our observation of the candidates'
behaviour in answering questions leads us to believe that if
claim networks are to work well great clarity of language
will be required. For the model we tested, the network
contained very little text compared to the written review
(although it is possible within the ScholOnto framework to
attach detailed descriptions to nodes). This means that the
understanding of the participants rested heavily on a few
words. If there was an ambiguity, or if they were unfamiliar
with the technical vocabulary in a field they could easily
form a false opinion. This was less common for the Review
group. Ambiguity itself is an issue relating to the content of
the network model rather than any affordances of the
tools, but there are interesting future challenges in building
tools which support users in expressing themselves as
clearly as possible.
Participant C makes assumptions about social networks
research that are not true, probably reflecting her background
in hypertext which forms a view of what properties
a link has.
The influence of the students' backgrounds was a strong
factor in the kinds of questions they chose. For example
participant E is interested in adaptive algorithms, while F is
studying natural language processing.
Four of the participants (A, C, D and F) provide
answers which go beyond the information in the artefacts.
They have clearly realized that to formulate a research
question they will have to go beyond what has already been

done. Since they are split equally between the two groups
it can be argued that the claim network was at least as
good at communicating the information needed to start
formulating research questions as the review. However
the small number of participants restricts the generality
of conclusions which can be drawn without further
investigation.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">5.2.2.4. Tool usage patterns in the Claim Network</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">group. Finally we used the recordings of the Claim
Network group's sessions to assess how the functions
of the search tools were used. The numbers of search
actions performed by the three participants were noted
and divided into those using three different ClaimFinder
search interfaces (Find, Discovery and Advanced), those
using the ClaiMaker system and those using three of the
icon links illustrated in Fig. 6. Search action data is
presented in Table 7 and Fig. 19. In addition to the actions
of the three participants, we have included in Table 7 a
summary of the search actions of an expert user (the
second author) who tested the questionnaire prior to the
main experiment.
The most heavily used features were the Find search in
ClaimFinder (18%), a simple search for keywords in
concepts and the Anchor icon (42%), which selects a
concept to be the focus of a Neighbourhood search, as
described in Section 4.2.3. This pattern of use reflects the
dominant searching strategy, which was to perform a
keyword-based search to locate the topic required and then
to explore the local region of the network.
All three participants used some of the Discovery and
Advanced search features in ClaimFinder. This was sometimes
because the dominant Find/Anchor pattern had
failed, but another motivation seemed to be simple
exploration; as they grew more used to the results of the
simple Find they explored new techniques.
Only one participant (A) used any of the ClaiMaker
features even though all the participants were shown that
shortcuts to both were given on the toolbar. Participant A

previous experience of using ClaiMaker. He used it briefly
at the beginning of his session before concentrating on the
more attractive ClaimFinder interface.
Participants B and C showed a bias towards using the
Concept and Document icons, respectively. Both used them
mainly for checking bibliographic data, which is duplicated
in the two places. This may merely reflect habits established
by early success with one method or the other. It perhaps
indicates that the two icons could be merged to reduce
clutter in the display.
When we compare the actions taken by the three
students with those of the expert user (Fig. 20) we saw a
similar foraging behaviour with use of an initial service
followed by repeated use of the anchor icon for exploration.
As would be expected, the expert has a much wider
repertoire of actions and the initial service was not usually
the Find service in ClaimFinder.

He used the ''unfriendly'' ClaiMaker a lot more, 22% of
actions compared to 2% for the students. This may be
partly because the expert had more than 2 years experience
of using ClaiMaker so tended to turn to it before the less
familiar (to him) ClaimFinder interface. However there is
evidence that he was exploiting services and controlling
parameters via the ClaimMaker interface that were not
available through ClaimFinder. Fig. 21 gives a breakdown
of the ClaiMaker actions of the expert user and the actions
included in the ''other'' category.
Some of the expert's ClaiMaker actions mirror the
ClaimFinder usage of the Claim Network group. He used
Neighbourhood six times, which gave him the same output
as the Find service in ClaimFinder, but more control over
the parameters he could search for, e.g., he could search for
words in the title of an article as well as keywords in
Concepts. His searches for concepts by keyword and IP
Owner mirrored the kind of services that can be found
through the ClaimFinder Advanced menu.
His use of link tracking (see Fig. 10 and screen movie
clip8), however, shows him using a service which was not
put into ClaimFinder because it was considered too
complex for a novice user. It gives the user a lot of
options, including keywords in left- or right-hand concepts,
specific link types, groups of link types drawn from the
taxonomy and the depth of search. Having done a linktracking
search the expert user would then often explore
the TouchGraph visualization of the results, by clicking the
TouchGraph icon, a form of presentation which the
students did not use heavily.</zone>

argued that the review had added value over the Claim
Network. Furthermore the Written Review group had a
major advantage in terms of experience with the artefacts.
Both groups gave appropriate answers to the questions
suggesting that the claim network was interpretable by
users other than its creator. In terms of tool use, the three
Claim Network participants concentrated mainly on using
the simpler functions. However the ClaimFinder tool
seemed to invite them to use more complex functions as
their confidence increased. The expert user's usage patterns
suggest that, with increased 'literacy' with these new tools,
users develop more complex search strategies.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">6. Conclusions</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">New technologies, such as digital libraries, have increased
the availability of documents dramatically. For
researchers this has generated a need for better tools to
make sense of the many papers they can now access. In the
Scholarly Ontologies project, we proposed a computational
approach to support such scholarly sensemaking. Our
argument is that classical truth maintenance models would
not be fit for this purpose. Instead the scheme adopted
must enable evidence to be presented simultaneously in
favour of claims and complemented by counter-claims.
Thus we propose an ontology of rhetorical relations for
principled agreement and disagreement which can support
multiple interpretations. This uses a claim network
representation to model a document's key contributions
and relationships to the literature. The network approach
has focussed our knowledge modelling effort on capturing
relationships between objects, rather than simply indexing
instances of objects. To this end the Scholarly Ontologies
project has investigated a new kind of digital library server
in which it would be possible to go beyond searching
metadata and to ask questions more pertinent to research.
In this paper, we have presented three related prototype
systems which have been developed during the project to
support users in the creation and exploration of claim</zone>

  <zone label="GEN_OTHER">443</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">networks, namely ClaiMaker, ClaiMapper and ClaimFinder.
We also presented a two-phase evaluation study in
which a review was made of a multi-disciplinary domain
during which a claim network was built. Two groups of
students, one group using a written literature review based
on this modelling and the other using the claim network
itself, answered questions about the domain. This case
study allowed us to investigate the utility of the tools and
the approach. The results of the case study indicate that the
claim network approach presented here can support
services which address questions like ''where did this idea
come from?'' and ''what evidence supports this idea?''
Furthermore, it was observed that as the review progressed
the degree of order in the models produced in the
ClaiMapper interface increased, suggesting that it was able
to support and reflect back to the analyst, the process of
conceptual refinement, an important part of sensemaking
activity.
The case study has demonstrated that claim networks
helped the participants to form their own opinions. For
instance, the Claim Network participants were more
inclined than the Written Review group to construct
personal answers rather than to extract answers from the
artefact as if they were ''truth''. Possibly this is because the
relative sparseness of the network representation forces the
user to mentally fill in some of the gaps in the information
they are presented with, or it may simply be that dealing
with an unfamiliar representation forces the user to think
harder, with a richer articulation of ideas as a positive sideeffect.
While it is beyond the scope of this study to
speculate further on the cognitive processes of the
participants, it is worth noting that working with the claim
networks brought out some different thinking skills in line
with positive results reported for the use of argument
visualization in teaching reasoning skills (Carr, 2003) and
for mind mapping in education (Novak and Gowin, 1984).
In addition, we observed a common search strategy in
which the students using the claim network performed a
simple search to locate a node with the right keywords in it
and then explored the region of claims around it, often
using the anchor icon to initiate neighbourhood searches.
This behaviour is typical of the information foraging
behaviour described by Pirolli and Card (1999). The users
are locating what is called an ''information patch'' and
then grazing on the information in the patch until either
they can answer the question to their satisfaction or they
have exhausted the information there and need to move to
a new patch. Although the data from this case study is
limited to only three users, all of them demonstrated
foraging behaviour, which is common in information
systems generally. It seems reasonable to conclude that it
was an important way for them to interact with these
models. The next round of tool development should
therefore focus on developing the functionality of browsing
tools and the clarity of their outputs to help users forage as
effectively as possible. ACT-IF, the formal process model
presented by Pirolli and Card in their 1999 paper to
describe information foraging, presents a candidate cognitive
modelling approach to evaluate new tools or interfaces
aimed at supporting browsing.
The sparseness of the representation had disadvantages;
when the representation was ambiguous it could cause
misunderstanding. It seems that if claim networks are to be
used collaboratively the users will have to learn to express
themselves precisely, which is to say in the terms that their
community will understand. Ambiguities may also emerge
as triggers for debate when communities start working
together on building networks.
Finally, while it was demonstrated that the claim
networks can convey information about a subject domain,
we do not claim it is a substitute for text. Text allows the
author more flexibility in constructing the narrative and
more influence on the reader because the author has
control of the order in which information is presented. Our
observations suggest that our participants could handle
information in written format faster than using the claim
network. That said, the prose review and claim network
were both relatively small and the Claim Network group
had much less experience of the medium than the Written
Review group. It is possible that if the written review had
been longer and the users of the claim network had more
experience, it would have been possible to better show the
benefits of the search services.
In summary, the ScholOnto research project has been
envisioning how scholarly knowledge may be published
and contested in the future. A variety of prototype tools
have been developed in our pursuit of an environment
which would enable analysts to express their perspective of
the ideas in a literature, which could then be published and
interrogated as a personal, or shared, model. The evaluation
reported has taken the first step by demonstrating that
given the right tool, literature analysis can be assisted by
the construction of claim networks and that, within the
limits of the study reported, these networks could
effectively convey information to users other than their
creator. Although the tools we produced support groupworking
at a technical level, we have not yet studied their
synchronous or asynchronous use in collaborative environments.
We conclude that the Scholarly Ontologies
approach to sensemaking is worthy of further investigation,
to improve and further evaluate the tools.</zone>
